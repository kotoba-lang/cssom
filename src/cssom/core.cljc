  "Small CSS selector/cascade subset for kotoba documents.

   Split out of kotoba-lang/browser (ADR-2607051140). Not to be confused with
   kotoba-lang/css, an unrelated EDN-as-CSS-data renderer (data -> CSS text);
   this namespace goes the other direction: parses CSS text and resolves the
   cascade against a kotoba.wasm.dom document.

   Beyond tag/id/class/attribute simple selectors and the child/descendant
   combinators, this namespace also supports:
   - Sibling combinators `+` (adjacent) and `~` (general/subsequent).
   - `::before` / `::after` pseudo-elements (also the legacy single-colon
     `:before`/`:after` spelling). kotoba.wasm.dom has no generated-content
     DOM node concept, so pseudo-element declarations are resolved into a
     synthetic `:pseudo/before` / `:pseudo/after` attribute on the *real*
     element (`apply-cascade`/`computed-style`), holding that
     pseudo-element's own cascade-resolved style map -- also directly
     queryable via `pseudo-element-style-for` without a full apply-cascade
     round trip. A `content` declaration that is a quoted string literal
     (`content: \"...\";` / `'...'`, including the empty string) is unquoted
     into a plain string under `:content`; a bare `attr(name)` reference
     (`content: attr(data-foo);` -- e.g. the common `[title]::after {
     content: \" (\" attr(title) \")\"; }` idiom) resolves to the
     *originating* element's own real HTML attribute value at
     cascade-resolution time (a missing attribute resolves to `\"\"`,
     matching real CSS -- not the same as `content` being absent), also
     ending up as a plain string under `:content`; a bare `counter(name)`
     reference (`content: counter(item);`, the single most common
     generated-content idiom for automatic numbering -- e.g. a `<li>` with
     `counter-increment: item` and `::before { content: counter(item) \".
     \"; }`) resolves to that named counter's CURRENT value at this exact
     point in the document tree. Unlike `attr()`, a counter is NOT resolvable
     from one node in isolation -- its value is the cumulative effect of
     every `counter-reset`/`counter-increment` declaration on every element
     that precedes it in document tree order -- so it can only be resolved
     correctly by `apply-cascade`'s own top-down tree walk (see its
     docstring for how the running counters map is threaded alongside the
     existing custom-property environment); `computed-style`/
     `pseudo-element-style-for` called standalone, with no real tree walk
     backing them, honestly leave `:content` unset for a `counter()`
     reference rather than guessing a number (see their own docstrings). A
     mix of quoted-literal, `attr()`, and/or `counter()` terms in one
     declaration (`content: \"Price: \" attr(data-price);` /
     `content: counter(item) \". \";`) is supported too, concatenated in
     source order. Other unsupported forms (`counter()`'s two-argument
     `name, <list-style-type>` form, e.g. `counter(item, upper-roman)`,
     `url(...)`, `none`/`normal`, unquoted text, `attr()`'s extended `name
     type, fallback` syntax) simply leave `:content` unset rather than
     storing something unusable. `cssom.layout` reads these attributes and
     paints generated content as real text immediately before/after the
     element's real children -- see its namespace docstring.
   - `counter-reset`/`counter-increment` declarations (`counter-reset: item
     5;` / `counter-increment: item;`, one or more `<name> [<integer>]?`
     pairs each -- see `parse-counter-property`): parsed as ordinary
     properties (default reset value 0, default increment amount 1, matching
     real CSS), but their EFFECT (mutating a named-counter map as
     `apply-cascade` walks the document) only happens as part of that same
     tree walk described above -- a simplification this engine makes
     honestly explicit: counters live in one flat, per-document namespace
     (real CSS technically scopes them to element nesting in a more complex
     way this engine does not attempt).
   - `@media (min-width: Npx)` / `(max-width: Npx)` conditional rule blocks
     (optionally combined with `and`), evaluated against a viewport width
     passed to `apply-cascade` via an options map (default
     `default-viewport-width`).
   - `@container [<name>]? (min-width: Npx)` / `(max-width: Npx)` /
     `(width: Npx)` conditional rule blocks (optionally combined with `and`,
     optionally named -- `@container sidebar (min-width: 400px)` -- via the
     `container-name` property; `container-type: inline-size` / `size`
     marks an element as a query container in the first place -- see
     `parse-rules`/`split-container-segments` for the at-rule grammar and
     `container-condition-matches?`/`container-rule-matches?` for matching).
     Unlike `@media`'s single, globally-known viewport width, a container's
     size is normally only known once real layout has run -- this engine's
     cascade/layout pipeline is a strict one-directional pipe (`apply-cascade`
     finishes completely, writing every element's final `:style/*` attrs,
     and only then does `cssom.layout` consume them; there is no
     re-cascade-after-layout step or relayout loop). Rather than adding one,
     `apply-cascade` supports the one honestly-scoped case that does NOT
     need real layout at all: a container whose OWN `width` (and, if
     present, `min-width`/`max-width`) is a literal, already-cascade-resolved
     NUMBER -- i.e. the author wrote a plain `<n>`/`<n>px` value (or a
     CONSTANT `calc(...)` this namespace's own numeric coercion already
     collapses to one, e.g. `calc(400px - 100px)` -- see `parse-style-value`
     -- since by the time this pass runs, that's already indistinguishable
     from a literal number), not `auto`, a percentage, a non-constant
     `calc(...)` (one mixing in `%`/`em`/any other relative unit), `fit-
     content`, or anything flex/grid/content-driven -- via one extra,
     bounded (never iterated/looped)
     cascade pass that resolves every container's own width BEFORE any
     `@container` rule is allowed to match anything (see apply-cascade's
     docstring for exactly how the two passes fit together, and
     `container-rule-matches?`'s docstring for why an unresolvable
     container width, or no matching container ancestor at all, makes an
     `@container` rule honestly NOT apply -- never a guess). Known,
     documented non-goals: a container whose own size depends on layout
     (auto/percentage/flex-basis/grid-driven widths), NESTED/chained
     container queries (a container whose own qualifying width is itself
     set by an ANCESTOR container's `@container` rule -- this engine only
     resolves one level, see apply-cascade), the block-size/height axis
     (`container-type: size` is accepted but this engine has no height
     query feature to offer regardless), the `container` shorthand property
     (only the `container-type`/`container-name` longhands are parsed), and
     `or`/range syntax/`style()`/`scroll-state()` container queries (same
     narrow feature/combinator subset `@media` already has).
   - `:not(<selector>)` / `:is(<selector-list>)` / `:where(<selector-list>)`
     selector-FUNCTION pseudo-classes -- not to be confused with a bare
     pseudo-CLASS like `:hover`/`:disabled` (see `pseudo-class-pattern` vs
     `functional-pseudo-class-pattern`). `:not(<sel>)` matches an element
     that does NOT match `<sel>`; `:is(<sel-list>)` matches an element that
     matches ANY selector in a comma-separated list -- reusing
     `split-selector-list`, the exact same comma-splitting logic top-level
     `sel1, sel2 { ... }` rules already use, so whitespace/commas inside the
     parens behave identically (`selector-tokens`/`split-selector-list` both
     track paren-depth for this, alongside their existing bracket-depth
     tracking for attribute selectors); `:where(<sel-list>)` matches
     IDENTICALLY to `:is(...)` but -- the one easy-to-get-wrong difference
     this feature hinges on -- ALWAYS contributes ZERO specificity, whereas
     `:not()`/`:is()` contribute the specificity of their own most specific
     argument, per occurrence (real CSS 4 behavior; see `specificity`/
     `simple-selector-specificity`). Scoped, documented limitation: the
     argument inside the parens supports simple/compound selectors only
     (tag/id/class/attribute/pseudo-class combinations) -- no descendant/
     child/sibling combinators and no NESTED functional pseudo-classes
     inside the parens (see `parse-simple-selector`'s own docstring for
     exactly what that does and doesn't cover). This scope covers the
     overwhelming majority of real-world usage: `:not(.hidden)`,
     `:is(h1, h2, h3)`, `:where(.card, .panel)` are all compound-selector-
     only in practice.
   - `:has(<relative-selector-list>)`, the CSS 'parent selector' --
     `.card:has(.badge)` matches a `.card` that CONTAINS a `.badge`
     somewhere inside it, `li:has(input:checked)` matches an `<li>`
     containing a checked input. Parses through the exact same
     `functional-pseudo-class-pattern` + `split-selector-list` path as
     `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` above (`has` is simply one more name in
     that pattern's alternation) into its own `:selector/has` key -- but
     unlike those three, `:has()` is architecturally NEW for this
     namespace, not just another selector-list consumer: every OTHER
     pseudo-class here (`:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()`, the structural
     pseudo-classes, `:root`/`:empty`, `:lang()`, `:nth-last-child()`)
     tests a candidate node against its ANCESTOR chain or its SIBLINGS --
     walking UP or SIDEWAYS via `document`. `:has()` needs the OPPOSITE
     direction: for a candidate anchor node, walking DOWN into its own
     subtree and testing each DESCENDANT against a selector. This
     namespace already has exactly the traversal primitive that needs,
     though, for an unrelated feature: `descendant-node-ids` (a
     document/node-id -> flat descendant-node-id walk, via each node's own
     `:children` vector) already backs `selected-option-id`/
     `radio-group-node-ids` elsewhere in this file -- `has-arg-descendant-match?`
     reuses it verbatim rather than inventing a second downward walker.
     Each candidate descendant is tested with `matches-simple?` (NOT
     `matches?` -- a `:has()` argument item is always a single bare
     compound selector, never a combinator chain, so no descendant/sibling
     combinator walking is needed on top of the subtree walk itself),
     short-circuiting (`some`) the instant one descendant matches (real
     `:has()` semantics: ANY match is enough).

     Scoped, documented limitation, mirroring the exact same cut
     `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` already made above, for the same reason
     (the overwhelming majority of real-world usage fits it): each
     comma-separated item of the argument is a single compound selector
     (tag/id/class/attr/pseudo -- including a NESTED bare pseudo-class like
     `:has(input:checked)`, one of the most common real patterns), never a
     combinator chain INSIDE the argument (`:has(div p)` is out of scope,
     same as `:is(.a .b)` above). On top of that compound-selector-only
     cut, `:has()` supports exactly one optional LEADING combinator per
     comma-separated item -- `>` (`:has(> img)`: 'has a DIRECT CHILD img',
     not just any img anywhere inside), `~` (`:has(~ p)`: has a LATER
     SIBLING p) and `+` (`:has(+ p)`: the immediately next element sibling
     is a p). `:selector/has` stores each item as `{:has/selector
     <compound> :has/combinator <kw>}` (see `parse-has-item`), and matching
     dispatches to `has-arg-child-match?` (node's immediate `:children`
     only), `has-arg-sibling-match?` (the parent's later element children)
     or `has-arg-descendant-match?` (the full subtree). The two sibling
     forms are forward-only, which is what real CSS's `~`/`+` mean.
     Deliberately OUT of scope, and unsupported (never crashes, just
     never matches that form specially): the `:scope` pseudo-class itself,
     and -- same as `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` -- any combinator chain or
     nested functional pseudo-class inside one compound-selector argument.
     Like `:root`/`:lang()`/the structural pseudo-classes, matching an
     element against its own subtree obviously needs `document` (`node`'s
     `:children` are only ids -- resolving them to real nodes needs
     `document`), so `:has()` never matches via the document-less 2-arity
     `matches?`/`matches-simple?` form (`has-group-matches?` honestly
     returns false rather than attempting a documentless walk). `:has()`
     contributes specificity exactly like `:not()`/`:is()` do (the
     specificity of its own most specific argument, per occurrence,
     combinators contributing nothing extra -- see
     `simple-selector-specificity`), never `:where()`'s always-zero
     treatment.
   - Structural pseudo-classes `:first-child`/`:last-child`/`:only-child`
     and `:nth-child(<An+B>)`, plus their same-tag-only counterparts
     `:first-of-type`/`:last-of-type`/`:nth-of-type(<An+B>)`. Unlike
     `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` (a NEW parsing category -- a
     selector-LIST argument needing `functional-pseudo-class-pattern` +
     `split-selector-list`), these fit the EXISTING plain-pseudo-class path
     (`pseudo-class-pattern` already captures the bare `:name`, parens and
     all, exactly as it always has -- see `parse-simple-selector`): only
     `:nth-child()`/`:nth-of-type()` carry an argument at all, and it is
     always a short An+B micro-syntax token (a bare integer, `even`/`odd`,
     or `<n-coefficient>n<+-offset>` like `2n+1`/`-n+3`/`n+2`) that never
     itself contains parens -- so a small dedicated regex
     (`nth-pseudo-class-pattern`) captures just that argument string
     alongside the existing pseudo-name capture, parsed separately by
     `parse-nth-expression` into an `[A B]` pair. Matching (`nth-matches?`,
     `matches-pseudo?`) reuses the same sibling-traversal building blocks
     the `+`/`~` combinators already established (`parent-node-id`,
     document-order children filtered to `:element`-type only -- text
     nodes never count toward sibling position, matching real CSS): a
     node's 1-indexed position among its parent's element children (ALL of
     them, for the `:nth-child`/`:first-child`/`:last-child`/`:only-child`
     family) or among only its SAME-TAG-NAME siblings (for the
     `:nth-of-type`/`:first-of-type`/`:last-of-type` family -- e.g. among
     alternating `<p>`/`<span>` siblings, `:nth-of-type` position resets
     per tag while `:nth-child` position does not). `p = A*n + B` for some
     integer `n >= 0` is the real CSS An+B matching rule (`nth-matches?`);
     an element with no parent at all (a detached/root node) never matches
     any of these, same as real CSS.

     `:nth-child(<An+B>)`/`:nth-of-type(<An+B>)` also have their own
     from-the-end mirrors, `:nth-last-child(<An+B>)`/
     `:nth-last-of-type(<An+B>)` -- real CSS's way of counting backward from
     the LAST matching sibling instead of forward from the first (e.g.
     `:nth-last-child(1)` means 'the last child', `:nth-last-child(-n+2)`
     means 'the last two children', both common real-world idioms). This
     needed no new micro-syntax or parser at all: the An+B argument grammar
     is byte-for-byte identical (`nth-pseudo-class-pattern`'s regex just
     grew two more name alternatives, `parse-nth-expression` is reused
     completely unchanged), and the only genuinely new piece of logic is
     which sibling INDEX gets tested against that same `[A B]` pair.
     `nth-pseudo-matches?` already computed `node`'s 1-indexed FORWARD
     position and the full relevant sibling set (`structural-siblings`/
     `sibling-position`) to answer `:nth-child`/`:nth-of-type` -- reversing
     that into a from-the-end index needs no second, backward sibling walk,
     just arithmetic on numbers already in hand:
     `total-siblings - forward-position + 1` (position `total` -- the last
     sibling -- reverses to 1; position 1 -- the first -- reverses to
     `total`). `nth-matches?`'s own An+B arithmetic then runs against that
     reversed index exactly as it does against a forward one, including
     correctly for a negative A coefficient like `:nth-last-child(-n+2)`
     (there is nothing special about negative A once the index itself is
     already the right one to test -- see `nth-pseudo-matches?`'s own
     docstring for the reversal formula and a worked example).
   - `:root` and `:empty`, two more argument-less pseudo-classes fitting the
     same plain-pseudo-class path the structural pseudo-classes above use
     (no parser changes needed at all -- `pseudo-class-pattern` already
     captures both bare names). `:root` matches ONLY the document's own
     root element -- `kotoba.wasm.dom`'s document map already names that
     element's node-id under a `:root` KEY (set by `dom/set-root`, read by
     `apply-cascade`'s own top-down walk and elsewhere in this namespace,
     e.g. `radio-group-node-ids`) -- not to be confused with the `:root`
     CSS pseudo-CLASS of the same name; matching is simply comparing
     `node`'s own `:node/id` against that key (`matches-pseudo?`), the same
     document-dependent restriction `:focus` already has (needs `document`;
     never matches via the document-less 2-arity `matches?`/
     `matches-simple?` form). `:empty` matches an element with NO children
     AT ALL, of any node type -- a stricter, and different, question than
     the structural pseudo-classes' element-only sibling counting above:
     real CSS's `:empty` counts a `:text` child too, UNLESS that text
     node's data is genuinely zero-length -- so a WHITESPACE-only text
     child (a single space/newline between tags) still counts as content
     (non-zero length), meaning `<div> </div>` does NOT match `:empty`,
     only a truly childless `<div></div>` does (verified against real
     browser behavior, not assumed -- see `child-counts-as-content?`).
   - `:lang(<tag>)`, a pseudo-class FUNCTION taking a comma-separated list of
     BCP-47-ish language tags/ranges (`:lang(en)`, `:lang(en, fr)`). Unlike
     `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` (a selector-list argument, needing
     `functional-pseudo-class-pattern` + `split-selector-list`) or
     `:nth-child()`/`:nth-of-type()` (an An+B micro-syntax argument), this
     argument is its own narrow micro-syntax -- a comma-separated list of
     bare identifiers and/or quoted strings (`lang-pseudo-class-pattern`
     captures the raw argument text exactly like `nth-pseudo-class-pattern`
     does, since a lang-range list never itself contains parens either;
     `parse-lang-ranges` then splits/unquotes it), each compared against the
     element's OWN computed language: the nearest `lang` HTML attribute
     found walking from the element ITSELF upward through its ancestor
     chain (`computed-lang`, reusing the exact same `parent-node-id`
     ancestor-chain walk `disabled-by-fieldset?`/`disabled-by-optgroup?`
     already established elsewhere in this namespace for a different
     purpose -- see the structural-pseudo-classes paragraph above for that
     precedent too) -- the element's own `lang` attribute wins if present
     and non-blank, otherwise the nearest ancestor's, matching real CSS
     language inheritance; an element with no non-blank `lang` attribute
     anywhere from itself up to the document root has no computed language
     at all and never matches any `:lang()` argument (a blank `lang=\"\"`
     -- real HTML/CSS's own way of saying 'explicitly unknown language' --
     is treated exactly like no `lang` attribute at all: `computed-lang`
     keeps walking up past it rather than treating \"\" as a real, if
     empty, tag).

     A single range matches case-insensitively when it is a WHOLE-SUBTAG
     prefix of the computed tag, `-`-separated (`lang-range-matches-tag?`)
     -- e.g. `:lang(en)` matches `lang=\"en\"`/`lang=\"en-US\"`/
     `lang=\"EN-us\"` but NOT `lang=\"eng\"` (real CSS's own
     subtag-boundary rule: a language range must match one or more WHOLE
     leading subtags, never just a bare string prefix -- `[\"en\"]` is a
     whole-subtag prefix of `[\"en\" \"us\"]` but is not, and can never be,
     a whole-subtag prefix of `[\"eng\"]`, even though \"en\" is a plain
     STRING prefix of \"eng\") -- and the
     comma-separated list matches if ANY range in it does (`:lang(en, fr)`
     matches either English or French content). Deliberately out of scope:
     RFC 4647 extended filtering's `*` wildcard subtag syntax
     (`:lang(*-fr)`/`:lang(de-*-DE)`) -- rare in practice; the overwhelming
     majority of real-world `:lang()` usage is a plain tag or comma list of
     plain tags, e.g. `:lang(en)`/`:lang(en, fr, de)`, exactly this
     engine's scope. Like `:root` and the structural pseudo-classes above,
     `:lang()` needs `document` to walk the ancestor chain at all, so it
     never matches via the document-less 2-arity `matches?`/
     `matches-simple?` form (the same restriction `:focus`/`:first-child`
     already have). This trusted-subset parser has no `xml:lang` concept at
     all -- only the plain HTML `lang` attribute exists here -- so
     `:lang()` checking only `lang` isn't a gap, it's the correct, complete
     behavior for this engine's scope (real CSS additionally falls back to
     `xml:lang` only for XML documents, which this engine doesn't model).
   - CSS custom properties (`--foo: value`) and `var(--foo[, fallback])`
     resolution, inherited top-down the same way `apply-cascade` walks the
     document from its root.
   - `@layer <name> { ... }` cascade layers, plus the bare
     `@layer name1, name2;` ordering statement. For normal (non-`!important`)
     declarations, a later-declared layer beats an earlier one; for
     `!important` declarations, real CSS *reverses* that order (an
     earlier-declared layer beats a later one), and this engine implements
     that reversal too. Either way, any unlayered declaration beats every
     layered one of the same importance regardless of specificity -- layer
     membership is checked before specificity, not instead of it. See
     `parse-rules` for exactly how layer name -> priority resolution works,
     and its docstring for the remaining known simplifications (anonymous
     `@layer { ... }` blocks treated as unlayered, `@media` nested inside
     `@layer` loses its layer tag); see `resolve-style-for` for the
     `!important` reversal mechanics, including real inline-style
     `!important` support.
   - `calc(...)` arithmetic expressions -- but only the genuinely bounded,
     ALWAYS layout-independent subset: an expression whose ENTIRE contents
     are constant numeric literals (plain numbers and/or `px` lengths --
     NOT `%`/`em`/`vh`/`vw`/any other unit) combined with `+`/`-`/`*`/`/`
     and parens, e.g. `calc(100px + 20px)` -> `120`, `calc(2 * 8px)` ->
     `16`, `calc(100px / 4)` -> `25`. Real CSS `calc()` can mix absolute
     (`px`) with relative (`%`/`em`/viewport units/...) lengths that only
     resolve at LAYOUT time against a container's actual size -- the same
     'needs layout, which this cascade-then-layout pipeline doesn't have at
     cascade time' gap `@container` queries hit (see
     `resolvable-container-width`) -- so that general case is deliberately
     out of scope, not approximated. See `parse-calc`/`parse-calc-ast`/
     `eval-calc-node` for the tokenize -> parse (correct `*`/`/`-before-
     `+`/`-` precedence, left-to-right same-precedence associativity, so
     `calc(10px - 5px - 2px)` -> `3`, not `10 - (5 - 2)`) -> evaluate
     pipeline, and real CSS's own arithmetic-validity rules this honors:
     `min()` / `max()` / `clamp()` are evaluated over the SAME constant
     subset and by the same parser -- a math function is a primary in the
     expression grammar, so they nest in both directions
     (`calc(min(100px, 50px) + 10px)` -> `60`,
     `min(calc(10px + 5px), 20px)` -> `15`) and `clamp(lo, v, hi)` is
     literally `max(lo, min(v, hi))` (so `clamp(90px, 5px, 300px)` -> `90`,
     not `5`). Every argument of a comparison function must carry the same
     unit, real CSS's own rule; a percentage or any other relative unit
     inside one puts the whole value outside the subset exactly as it does
     inside `calc()`, so `min(50%, 300px)` degrades to a raw string rather
     than being guessed at against a containing block this pass does not
     have. See `math-function-names` for the authority on which functions
     are in, and why `round()`/`mod()`/the trigonometric family are not.
     `+`/`-` require both sides to be the SAME kind (both plain numbers or
     both px lengths); `*` requires AT LEAST ONE side to be a plain
     unitless number (you can't multiply two lengths together); `/`'s
     divisor must be a plain unitless number (and non-zero). Wired into
     `parse-style-value` -- the general numeric/px coercion every
     declaration already goes through -- so every property gets it for
     free (`width`, `padding`, `margin`, `gap`, `top`/`left`, etc.); a
     `calc(...)` outside this subset (a percentage/other relative unit
     anywhere inside, an arithmetic-type violation, or a malformed
     expression) degrades to the SAME 'unusable, falls through as a raw
     unparsed string' treatment `calc()` already had before this subset was
     supported, never a guessed number. `cssom.layout` has its own SEPARATE,
     small mirror of this same constant-subset resolver for grid track
     lists (`grid-template-columns`/`grid-template-rows` are multi-token
     strings `parse-style-value` never touches at all -- see
     `parse-track-list`'s docstring), since that file already owns its own
     numeric coercion independent of this namespace (see its ns docstring).
   - Attribute selectors' optional trailing case-sensitivity FLAG --
     `[attr=val i]` / `[attr=val I]` (force case-INSENSITIVE matching,
     regardless of whether HTML happens to define that particular
     attribute as case-sensitive by default) and `[attr=val s]` /
     `[attr=val S]` (the explicit, no-op case-SENSITIVE default -- valid
     syntax that parses successfully and changes nothing) -- CSS Selectors
     Level 4's attribute-selector modifier, e.g. `[type=\"text\" i]`/
     `[lang=\"en\" i]`, a common real-world idiom for matching an HTML
     attribute value whose casing the author can't fully control.
     `attribute-selector-pattern`/`parse-attribute-selector` capture it
     into `:attr/case-insensitive?` (true only for `i`/`I`; `s`/`S` needs
     no special handling beyond parsing successfully), and
     `matches-simple?`'s attribute clause honors it by lower-casing BOTH
     `actual` and `value` before comparing -- the same `str/lower-case`
     convention `:lang()`'s subtag matching already established above --
     for EVERY operator this engine supports (`=`/`~=`/`^=`/`$=`/`*=`/
     `|=`, and the presence-only no-operator case, which the flag is
     simply irrelevant to), including `~=`'s own whitespace-split token
     set (each split token, not just the whole attribute value, needs the
     same lower-casing). Before this addition, `[attr=val i]` syntax
     didn't just fail to apply the flag: the flag token made the WHOLE
     bracket fail to match `attribute-selector-pattern` at all (no
     provision for anything besides whitespace between the value and the
     closing `]`), so the entire attribute constraint silently vanished
     from the compound selector -- an `[attr=val i]`-only compound
     selector matched EVERY element rather than the intended subset (a
     compound selector left with no tag/id/class/attr/pseudo constraints
     at all matches unconditionally), a worse failure mode than simply
     matching nothing. The flag must be separated from the value by REAL
     whitespace in this engine's regex (`\\s+`, not `\\s*`) -- not an
     arbitrary tightening: an unquoted attribute value tokenizes as a
     single maximal-munch identifier in real CSS, so `[data-x=abcs]` can
     never legitimately split into value `abc` + flag `s` (there is no
     whitespace token separating them, ever) -- and a `\\s*`-based
     (optional-whitespace) regex would, via ordinary greedy-then-backtrack
     matching, wrongly find exactly that split (backing the unquoted-value
     match off by one trailing character to let it double as the flag)
     the moment a mandatory-whitespace requirement isn't there to forbid
     it."

   Not here, and out of scope for the same reason a percentage inside

(def ^:private css-wide-keywords
  "The four CSS-wide keywords (CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 4 SS7),
   which every property accepts and which mean the same thing on all of
   them. Only `inherit` used to be handled here -- the other three were
   stored as the literal string, which no downstream reader recognizes, so
   `text-align: initial` reached `cssom.layout` as the word \"initial\" and
   `margin: revert` left the author's own `margin: 0` standing.

   Measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-05, in the corpus's own 14px monospace
   page, on a `<p>` inside a `<div>` that declared color/font-size/
   font-weight/font-style/text-align, with and without an author rule on
   the `<p>` itself:

   | keyword   | inherited property (`color`) | non-inherited (`display`) | UA-declared (`p`'s `margin`) |
   |-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
   | `initial` | black -- NOT the parent's    | `inline` -- NOT the UA `block` | 0 -- NOT the UA 1em |
   | `unset`   | the parent's green           | `inline` (= initial)      | 0 (= initial)                |
   | `revert`  | the parent's green           | `block` (the UA value)    | 14px (the UA 1em)            |
   | `inherit` | the parent's green           | the parent's own value    | the parent's own value       |

   The `initial` row is why this cannot be done by simply forgetting the
   declaration: a `<p style=\"display: initial\">` must report `inline`,
   and dropping the declaration would leave the UA sheet's `block`
   standing. `initial` has to WRITE a value (see `initial-values`), and it
   is the only one of the four that has to.

   `revert-layer` (CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 5) is the fifth, and
   is here because storing it as a literal string had the same shape of bug
   the four above did: `#x { width: 200px }` in one layer and
   `#x { width: revert-layer }` in the next left `cssom.layout` holding the
   word `revert-layer` as a width, which it cannot read, so the box fell
   back to `auto` and filled its container -- 800x20 against Brave's
   200x20. It rolls back to the value the property would have had if no
   declaration in the CURRENT LAYER existed; see
   `resolve-css-wide-keyword`'s `:revert-layer` clause for the six shapes
   measured behind that sentence."

(defn- expand-box-side-shorthand
  "Expands a `margin`/`padding` shorthand into its four per-side longhands
   using real CSS's own 1-to-4 value rule: one value applies to all four
   sides, two are vertical/horizontal, three are top/horizontal/bottom, and
   four are top/right/bottom/left clockwise.

   This is what makes the user-agent stylesheet expressible at all. Real UA
   rules are overwhelmingly one-axis -- `p { margin: 1em 0 }` is vertical
   only, `ul { padding-left: 40px }` is horizontal only -- and this engine's
   box model had a single UNIFORM margin/padding, so applying either would
   have moved the box in the wrong axis too. The conformance harness's
   geometry axis reported that ceiling precisely: `p` 40/54 and `li` 0/8
   failing for one shared, structural reason.

   The uniform `:margin`/`:padding` key is still emitted alongside the
   longhands (set to the first value) so every existing reader that has
   only ever known the uniform form keeps working unchanged.

   A token that is entirely a `var(--name[, fallback])` reference counts as
   expandable even though it is not a length YET. Custom properties are
   substituted much later (`style-element`, once the element's inherited
   environment is known), and NOTHING re-expanded a shorthand after that --
   so `padding: var(--pad)` with `--pad: 20px` resolved to a lone
   `:padding 20` with no per-side longhands at all, and this engine's box
   model reads only the longhands. Measured against a real browser by the
   conformance harness: `:cascade/custom-property` was one of the cases
   reporting a cascade-attributed `padding-left 0 -> 20px` mismatch.
   Expanding here, BEFORE substitution, is also what keeps the cascade
   honest: expansion has to happen at declaration time so that
   `padding: 12px; padding-left: 0` and `padding-left: 0; padding: 12px`
   still resolve differently (they do -- confirmed through the real
   pipeline). Re-expanding after the cascade had already merged would
   clobber a later, more specific longhand with the earlier shorthand.

   Each side therefore carries the var() reference verbatim and substitutes
   independently. When a custom property's own value is ITSELF a multi-value
   box shorthand (`--pad: 4px 8px`, then `padding: var(--pad)`), the four
   sides would each end up holding the whole substituted string -- so
   `resolve-style-map` re-slices exactly those keys once substitution has
   actually happened. That post-substitution step is the ONLY place a box
   shorthand is re-read after the cascade, and it is safe there precisely
   because it rewrites a value the substitution itself produced."

  "Expands the `inset` shorthand into `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` by the

   It is a separate function only because its longhands are BARE side
   names rather than `<prop>-<side>` ones -- `inset: 10px 20px` is
   `top: 10px; right: 20px; bottom: 10px; left: 20px`, not `inset-top`.
   Those four are the exact keys `layout-absolute-children` already reads
   (`node-style`'s `:top`/`:left`, and the `:right`/`:bottom` beside
   them), so nothing downstream needed a new concept.

   Measured before it was written, in Brave 151 over CDP:
   `<div style=\"width:300px;height:60px;position:relative\">
   <div style=\"position:absolute;inset:10px 20px\">a</div></div>`
   puts the inner box at x=20 y=10 w=260 h=40. Without this the shorthand
   was stored raw under an `:inset` key nothing reads, so the box fell
   back to its static position and shrink-to-fit width: 0,0,7x20.

   `auto` is admitted for the same reason it is admitted for `margin`: it
   is `inset`'s own INITIAL value and a real, common authored one
   (`inset: 0 auto`), and it travels as a raw string exactly as a
   directly-declared `top: auto` already does. So are PERCENTAGES, and for
   the same reason: `layout-absolute-children` already resolves a
   percentage `top`/`left` against the containing block (measured, and
   passing: `:position/absolute-percentage-offsets` and
   `:position/relative-percentage-offset`), so the four longhands this
   produces can read one. Note the basis is NOT the same as a percentage
   margin's: measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-06, `left: 50%` of a 200x60
   containing block is 100 and `top: 50%` is 30 -- each axis against its
   OWN dimension -- while a percentage margin or padding resolves against
   the INLINE size on all four sides. Two different rules that both spell
   `50%`; see `cssom.layout/percentage-box-basis`."

   worse than a scope-cut, an author's real shadow color was corrupted

   `:box-shadow-spread` before falling through to color.

   Unlike `text-shadow`, `box-shadow` is NOT a real inherited CSS
   property, so `none`/blank simply resolves to an EMPTY map (no

   This is the whole of `flex: 1`, which is the single most-used flex

   leaves the basis at `auto` and only distributes the leftover. Nothing
   here expanded it at all before, so `flex: 1` reached
   `cssom.layout/node-style` as an unread `:flex` key and every item kept
   its content width: measured against a real browser, two `flex: 1`
   items in a 300px row came out 7px and 70px where the browser gives

   [/<line-height>]?`, then a REQUIRED `<font-family>` list taking up the
   REST of the value) into a map of whichever of `:font-style`/`:font-
   weight`/`:font-size`/`:line-height`/`:font-family` it actually
   specifies -- previously read NOWHERE at all, `font` stored verbatim as
   a single unrecognized `:font` key (confirmed via direct REPL
   reproduction: `font: italic bold 14px/1.5 sans-serif` resolved to
   `{:font \"italic bold 14px/1.5 sans-serif\"}`, none of the 5 real
   longhands this shorthand expands to -- all already fully wired in
   `cssom.layout` -- ever actually set).

   Deliberately scoped to the single most common real-world form: the
   leading run only recognizes `italic`/`oblique` (style) and `bold`/
   `bolder`/`lighter`/a bare `100`-`900` multiple-of-100 (weight) --
   `font-variant`/`font-stretch` keywords and the reset value `normal`
   are recognized just enough to be consumed WITHOUT being mis-parsed as
   the start of `font-family`, but set no longhand of their own (neither
   property exists anywhere in this engine). The 6 real CSS system-font
   keywords (`caption`/`icon`/`menu`/`message-box`/`small-caption`/
   `status-bar`) are NOT supported, the same 'reasonable baseline, not
   full spec coverage' posture as the other 4 shorthand expanders in this
   file. Once the leading run ends, the VERY NEXT token is treated
   unconditionally as `<font-size>[/<line-height>]?` (matching real CSS's
   own strict positional grammar -- no further keyword-vs-size
   disambiguation needed), and everything after THAT token is rejoined
   with a single space into `:font-family` verbatim (a multi-word quoted
   family name like `'Times New Roman'` or a comma-separated fallback
   list like `Arial, sans-serif` both survive this whitespace-normalizing
   rejoin losslessly, unlike `expand-border-shorthand`'s own color-token
   limitation, since font-family is never classified token-by-token
   here).

   Both `<font-size>` and `<line-height>` (when present) are run through
   `parse-style-value`, exactly like a plain, non-shorthand `font-size`/
   `line-height` declaration would be -- so e.g. a bare `1.5` line-height
   survives as the same raw multiplier STRING `cssom.layout/resolve-line-
   height` already knows how to interpret, not a special shorthand-only
   representation. `font-style`/`font-weight` are also run through
   `parse-style-value` for the identical reason (a numeric weight like
   `700` needs to become the same coerced integer a plain `font-weight:
   700` declaration already produces elsewhere).

   Real CSS treats a `font` shorthand missing its mandatory `<font-size>`
   or `<font-family>` as an ENTIRELY invalid declaration (dropped
   wholesale, not partially applied) -- mirrored here by returning an
   empty map rather than guessing, this file's own established degrade-
   don't-guess convention for every other malformed/incomplete value."

(defn parse-declarations-with-importance
  "Parses a raw `property: value; ...` declaration-block string (e.g. a
   `<style>` rule body, or a JS-mutated `element.style.cssText`) into a
   `{property {:value v :important? bool}}` map -- for callers that need
   real per-property `!important` tracking, not just a corruption-free
   value (see `parse-declarations` for the simpler bare-value form).
   `important?` is true iff that declaration's raw value ended in a
   trailing `!important` (case-insensitive), which is stripped from
   `:value` either way.

   `:index` is the declaration's 0-based position in the block AFTER
   shorthand expansion, and it exists because the returned map cannot
   carry that order itself. A Clojure map literal is an array-map up to 8
   entries and a hash-map beyond, so a block of nine or more declarations
   -- which one `border` shorthand plus one `margin` already reaches --
   iterates in an order that has nothing to do with the source. Everything
   downstream of this used to depend on that accident: `resolve-style-for`
   sorts rule-based entries by :rule/order, which is the RULE's position in
   the sheet and identical for every declaration in one block, so the tie
   was broken by the map's own iteration order. CSS's rule is that the
   later declaration wins, and this is what lets that be said. It is the
   `all` shorthand that made it load-bearing rather than merely tidy --
   `width: 120px; all: initial` and `all: initial; width: 120px` are two
   different answers (measured in Brave 151, 2026-08-06: an auto-width
   inline box and a 120px one) and both are one block.

   When a property is declared twice in one block the later `:index` wins,
   because `into {}` keeps the last pair -- which is the same answer the
   `:value` already gave."

   (group 2). `:has(...)` (see the namespace docstring's own `:has()`

   the same shape: a comma-separated list captured as raw text, parsed
   downstream by `split-selector-list` -- only what happens to each parsed
   item afterward differs (`parse-has-item` additionally
   detects a leading `>` combinator, see `parse-simple-selector`).
   Deliberately distinct from `pseudo-class-pattern` (which matches the bare
   `:name` shape of an ordinary pseudo-class like `:hover`/`:disabled`): the
   trailing `\\(` this pattern requires right after the name is what keeps
   the two patterns from double-matching the same `:not`/`:is`/`:where`/

   leftover text -- see `parse-simple-selector`'s docstring for the concrete

   (`(?:[^()]|\\([^()]*\\))*`, the same bounded-nesting convention this
   namespace's own `calc()`/`var()` fallback parsing already uses) --
   previously captured as a strict `[^()]*` (deliberately unable to

   whose argument contained a parenthesized pseudo-class like
   `:nth-child()`/`:nth-of-type()`/`:lang()` -- a real, severe, and
   completely silent bug, not merely a documented scope-cut: confirmed
   via direct REPL reproduction before this fix that `li:not(:nth-child(1))`
   matched ZERO elements at all (not just the wrong ones), for every real
   list item that should have matched. Root cause: the old strict pattern
   simply failed to match the WHOLE `:not(...)` occurrence whenever its
   argument had its own parens, so `functional-matches` never captured it,
   the un-stripped literal `:not`/`:is`/`:where`/`:has` text then got
   mis-picked-up by the plain, argument-less `pseudo-class-pattern`
   instead (the exact same 'unrecognized bare pseudo-class' bug class this
   docstring's own paragraph above already documents for the
   `.special`-inside-`:not(.special)` case), and `matches-pseudo?`'s
   default `false` for an unrecognized name meant the ENTIRE compound
   selector could never match anything, silently, for one of real CSS's
   most common idioms (`:not(:nth-child(1))`, `:is(:nth-child(odd), .x)`).
   One level of nesting also incidentally starts correctly handling the
   previously-documented `:is(:not(.a))` shape too, confirmed via direct
   REPL check with no regression on any already-working case (`:not(.a,
   .b)`, `:is(h1, h2, h3)`, `:has(.badge)`, `:has(> img)` all still behave
   identically). Genuinely deeper nesting (two levels, e.g.
   `:is(:not(:nth-child(1)))`) remains out of scope -- the same bounded-
   nesting cut this file's own `calc()`/`var()` fallback already commits
   to, not a new or different limitation -- and an attribute selector's
   own `[...]` inside the argument is unaffected either way
   (`:not([hidden])`, `:has([hidden])`) since square brackets never
   conflict with this pattern's parens."

(defn parse-simple-selector
  "Parses one compound-selector token (see `selector-tokens`) into its
   tag/id/classes/attrs/pseudos/pseudo-element parts, plus the
   selector-FUNCTION pseudo-classes `:not(...)`/`:is(...)`/`:where(...)`/
   `:has(...)` (see `functional-pseudo-class-pattern` -- not to be confused
   with a bare pseudo-CLASS like `:hover`/`:disabled`, matched by
   `pseudo-class-pattern` instead).

   Every `:not(...)`/`:is(...)`/`:where(...)`/`:has(...)` occurrence is
   extracted FIRST (`functional-matches`) and stripped out of the working
   text (`s`, as opposed to `raw`, the untouched original) BEFORE any
   tag/id/class/attr/pseudo extraction runs on what's left. This ordering
   is essential, not cosmetic: without it, an argument like `.special`
   inside `:not(.special)` would otherwise be picked up by the plain class
   regex as though `.special` were a class on the OUTER compound selector
   itself -- this was a real bug: `:not(.special)`/`:is(.special)` never
   matched anything at all, because they were silently misparsed into \"has
   class special AND has an unrecognized :not/:is pseudo-class\"
   (unrecognized pseudo-classes never match, see `matches-pseudo?`'s
   default `false`), which could never be true for any element.

   Each `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` occurrence's parenthesized argument is
   parsed as a comma-separated SELECTOR LIST via `split-selector-list` --
   the exact same comma-splitting logic top-level `sel1, sel2 { ... }` rules
   already use, so whitespace/commas inside the parens behave identically
   (`selector-tokens`/`split-selector-list` both track paren-depth for
   this) -- into a vector of parsed compound selectors, `parse-simple-selector`
   itself called recursively on each comma-separated item (`parse-group`
   below). One such vector is stored as a GROUP under :selector/not /
   :selector/is / :selector/where per occurrence (almost always zero or one
   group each, but e.g. `:not(.a):not(.b)` correctly records two groups,
   both of which must hold -- see `matches-simple?` for exactly how groups
   combine, and `simple-selector-specificity` for how they contribute to
   specificity -- :where()'s groups are matched identically to :is()'s but
   deliberately NEVER consulted for specificity, always contributing zero).

   `:has()` (:selector/has) reuses this exact same
   `functional-pseudo-class-pattern` + `split-selector-list` parsing path
   (`has-groups` below mirrors `parse-group` almost verbatim) -- its
   argument is syntactically the same comma-separated selector-list shape
   -- but each parsed item is a `{:has/selector <compound>
   :has/combinator <kw>}` map instead of a bare compound-selector map:
   `parse-has-item` first checks for an optional LEADING `>`/`~`/`+`
   combinator (`:has(> img)`, `:has(~ p)`, `:has(+ p)`) and strips it
   before parsing the rest as an ordinary compound selector, recording
   which one it was as :has/combinator (`:descendant`, the far more common
   case, for a plain `:has(.badge)`-style item with no leading combinator
   at all -- 'has this ANYWHERE in the subtree'). :has/direct-child? is
   still emitted alongside it for readers that only knew the `>` form.
   See the namespace docstring's own
   `:has()` paragraph for why this pseudo-class needs a DOWNWARD tree walk
   -- architecturally new for this file -- and `matches-simple?`/
   `has-group-matches?` for how :selector/has is actually matched (never
   via `matches-pseudo?`, same as :selector/not/:selector/is/:selector/where
   above).

   `:not()`/`:is()`/`:where()` arguments MAY be complex selectors --
   `:is(.a .b)`, `:is(.a > .b)`, `:is(.a + .b)` -- and are parsed by
   `parse-arm` into a `:selector/parts` map that `matches-simple?` walks
   through `parts-match?` and `simple-selector-specificity` sums. That was
   a real gap and not a cosmetic one: until it landed, `:is(.a .b)` parsed
   as a single compound requiring BOTH classes on the same element, which
   is a different set of elements rather than a smaller one. See
   `complex-selector-arguments` for the seventeen shapes that were measured
   in Brave, including the one that makes an argument list's specificity
   observable. `:has()` keeps its own argument parser (`parse-has-item`),
   whose leading combinator is a RELATIVE selector rather than a complex
   one -- and which `:is()` correspondingly rejects, as Brave does.

   A single level of nesting inside the argument IS supported (a
   parenthesized pseudo-class like `:not(:nth-child(1))`/
   `:is(:nth-child(odd), .x)`, or a once-nested functional pseudo-class
   like `:is(:not(.a))` -- see `functional-pseudo-class-pattern`'s own
   docstring for the real, severe bug this fixed: previously EVERY
   occurrence with any parens in its argument silently matched nothing at
   all); genuinely DEEPER nesting (two levels, e.g.
   `:is(:not(:nth-child(1)))`) remains out of scope, the same bounded-
   nesting cut this file's own `calc()`/`var()` fallback parsing already
   commits to elsewhere -- it applies per COMPOUND, so each compound of a
   complex argument gets its own level, which is why
   `:is(:not(.q) .wB) span` works.

   Structural pseudo-classes (`:first-child`/`:last-child`/`:only-child`/
   `:nth-child()` and their `:first-of-type`/`:last-of-type`/
   `:nth-of-type()` same-tag counterparts, plus `:nth-child()`'s and
   `:nth-of-type()`'s own from-the-end mirrors `:nth-last-child()`/
   `:nth-last-of-type()`) need none of the above selector-list machinery --
   their bare names are already captured into `:selector/pseudos` by the
   ordinary `pseudo-class-pattern` regex just like `:hover`/`:disabled`
   always were (parens or not, that regex's match stops at the name either
   way). Only `:nth-child()`/`:nth-of-type()`/`:nth-last-child()`/
   `:nth-last-of-type()` carry an argument, and it is always a short An+B
   micro-syntax token, never a selector -- `nth-pseudo-class-pattern`
   captures that argument text alongside the pseudo name into
   `:selector/nth-args` (a `{pseudo-keyword raw-arg-string}` map), left for
   `matches-pseudo?` to parse (`parse-nth-expression`) and evaluate against
   the element's actual sibling position (forward for `:nth-child()`/
   `:nth-of-type()`, from-the-end for `:nth-last-child()`/
   `:nth-last-of-type()`) at match time (see the namespace docstring's
   structural-pseudo-classes paragraph).

   `:lang(...)` (see `lang-pseudo-class-pattern`) works exactly like
   `:nth-child()`/`:nth-of-type()` above -- its bare name is already
   captured into `:selector/pseudos`, and its raw comma-separated
   tag-list argument is captured separately into `:selector/lang-args`
   (same `{pseudo-keyword raw-arg-string}` shape as `:selector/nth-args`,
   just its own map rather than merged into that one -- mirroring how
   `:selector/not`/`:selector/is`/`:selector/where` each get their own key
   despite similar shapes), left for `matches-pseudo?` to parse
   (`parse-lang-ranges`) and evaluate against the element's computed
   language at match time (see the namespace docstring's `:lang()`
   paragraph)."

(defn- simple-selector-specificity
  "Specificity contribution -- a `[id-count class/attr/pseudo-count
   tag/pseudo-element-count]` 3-vector, see `specificity` below -- of a
   single already-parsed compound/simple selector map. Factored out from
   the public `specificity` (which just sums this across a full selector's
   :selector/parts) so this exact same per-compound computation can ALSO be
   applied, recursively, to a :not()/:is() argument (itself always a bare
   compound-selector map, never a full multi-part selector -- see
   `parse-simple-selector`'s compound-only scope for these functions'
   arguments) -- without a forward reference to `specificity` itself (this
   namespace deliberately avoids `declare`-based forward references, see
   `parse-counter-amount`'s docstring for precedent; `specificity` is
   defined further down this file than `parse-simple-selector`'s callers
   need, so this self-contained helper is defined first instead).

   `:not()`/`:is()` (:selector/not / :selector/is) each contribute the
   specificity of their OWN most specific argument, PER OCCURRENCE
   (`most-specific-in-group`), summed across however many occurrences this
   compound has (almost always zero or one each, but e.g.
   `:not(.a):not(.b)` correctly contributes both) -- real CSS 4 behavior.

   `:where()` (:selector/where) is DELIBERATELY never consulted here: it
   always contributes ZERO specificity regardless of its own argument's
   specificity -- the one easy-to-get-wrong divergence from `:is()` this
   whole feature hinges on getting right, and why `:where()` still needs
   its own :selector/where key (matched identically to :is() by
   `matches-simple?`) rather than reusing :selector/is verbatim.

   `:has()` (:selector/has) contributes EXACTLY like `:not()`/`:is()` above
   -- the specificity of its own most specific argument, per occurrence,
   never `:where()`'s always-zero treatment (real CSS: `:has()` is not
   special-cased away from specificity the way `:where()` is). Each
   :selector/has group holds `{:has/selector <compound> :has/direct-child?
   bool}` maps rather than bare compound-selector maps (see
   `parse-simple-selector`), so `has-groups` first unwraps each item to its
   own :has/selector before reusing `groups-specificity` unchanged -- the
   `>` combinator recorded alongside it is irrelevant here, matching real
   CSS's general rule that combinators themselves never contribute
   specificity."

;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;; CSS Nesting (CSS Nesting Module Level 1), as a DESUGARING over the raw
;; text, above every splitter below.
;;
;; It sits here, and rewrites text rather than rule maps, for two reasons
;; that are the whole design:
;;
;; 1. A nested conditional at-rule (`#x { color: blue; @media (...) {
;;    color: red } }`) has to come OUT as a top-level `@media (...) { #x {
;;    color: red } }` before `split-media-segments`/`split-layer-segments`/
;;    `split-container-segments` ever run, or the media condition has
;;    nowhere to be recorded -- `parse-rules` `assoc`s :rule/media onto
;;    whatever `parse-rules-raw` returns, which would CLOBBER an inner
;;    condition rather than compose with it. Desugaring to text lets all
;;    three at-rules compose with nesting for free, in both directions,
;;    with no new code in any of them.
;;
;; 2. It is bounded by a guard: `desugar-nesting` returns its input
;;    UNCHANGED unless a nested rule is actually present. Every splitter
;;    below is on the path of every stylesheet this engine has ever
;;    parsed, and a rewrite that only fires on the shape it was written
;;    for cannot move a stylesheet that does not have that shape.
;;
;; What `&` means, MEASURED in headless Brave 151.1.93.129 rather than
;; read off the spec (probe pages, one page per probe so a bare type
;; selector in one cannot reach another):
;;
;;   #q1 { color: blue; span { color: red } }     p blue, span red
;;   #q2 { span { color: red } color: blue }      p blue, span red
;;                                                (a declaration AFTER a
;;                                                nested rule still applies
;;                                                to the parent)
;;   #a8 { color: blue; span {...} color: green } p GREEN -- the parent's
;;                                                own declarations cascade
;;                                                among themselves in
;;                                                source order
;;   #q3 { b { ... } & i { ... } }                both match: a nested
;;                                                selector with no `&` gets
;;                                                an IMPLICIT descendant one
;;   #q8 { > b { ... } }                          `> b` is `& > b`
;;   #q9 { @media (min-width: 1px) { color: red } }   red
;;   #q10 { @media (min-width: 99999px) { ... } }     not applied
;;
;; And the one that is NOT textual substitution -- `&`'s SPECIFICITY is
;; `:is(<parent selector list>)`'s, i.e. the MOST SPECIFIC arm of the
;; parent list, even when the arm that actually matched is a weaker one:
;;
;;   #q4zz, .q4c { & span { color: red } }
;;   div.q4c span { color: blue }        Brave: RED
;;
;; `#q4zz` matches nothing on the page, and `.q4c span` alone would be
;; (0,1,1) and lose to `div.q4c span`'s (0,1,2). It wins because `&` is
;; `:is(#q4zz, .q4c)` = (1,0,0). The control that places that from the
;; other side, and which must NOT flip:
;;
;;   .q5c { & span { color: red } }
;;   div.q5c span { color: blue }        Brave: BLUE
;;
;; This engine already implements `:is()` and its max-of-arguments
;; specificity exactly (see `simple-selector-specificity`), so the
;; desugaring reuses it rather than adding a specificity concept:
;; `expand-nested-selector` emits `:is(...)` when the parent list needs it
;; and can be represented, and plain text otherwise. See that function for
;; the one shape that degrades and what it costs.

   means `& > b` / `& + p` / `& ~ p`; a selector with no `&` anywhere gets
   an IMPLICIT descendant `&`, so `#x { span { ... } }` is `#x span`.

   Then `&` is substituted, and WHICH substitution is the only place the
   parent list's arity matters:

   - ONE parent. Plain textual substitution, and it is exact -- `:is(X)`
     and `X` have identical specificity and identical matching for every
     X, including a complex one, so there is nothing for the `:is()` form
     to buy here.

   - SEVERAL parents. `:is(p1, p2, ...)`, which this engine parses and
     gives the max-of-arguments specificity real CSS gives it, whether the
     arms are compound or COMPLEX. Until complex arguments landed this
     branch was restricted to all-compound parent lists and everything
     else fell back to one expansion per parent, which matched exactly but
     gave each expansion its OWN specificity rather than the list's
     maximum. Measured cost of that fallback, in Brave 151.1.93.129 on
     2026-08-06: `#zz, .a .b { & span { color: red } }` against
     `div.a .b span { color: blue }` is RED there and was BLUE here.
     Its control, also measured, is `.q, .a .b { & span { … } }` against

   block competing with a declaration written AFTER it in the same block:

;; registration alive and accept any value. Nothing in this engine reads a

   - :rule/media -- the raw `@media` condition text (e.g.
     \"(min-width: 600px)\"), or a VECTOR of them when `@media` blocks are
     nested inside each other, or nil (always applies). `apply-cascade`
     decides which currently hold (`media-condition-matches?`).
   - :rule/supports -- the raw `@supports` condition text, same
     single-or-vector shape, or nil. Evaluated by
     `supports-condition-matches?`, which unlike `@media` needs no runtime
     context at all -- only this engine's own support oracle.
   - :rule/container / :rule/container-name -- the raw `@container`
     condition and its optional container name. NOT decided here: this
     needs a container's own resolved size, not one global number (see
     `container-rule-matches?`).
   - :rule/layer -- the layer's full DOTTED name (`\"o.i\"` for a `@layer i`
     nested inside `@layer o`, which real CSS says is the same layer as a
     top-level `@layer o.i`), or nil for unlayered. Each rule also carries
     :rule/layer-priority, resolved from the whole stylesheet's layer TREE
     by `layer-priority-map`.

   Unlayered rules resolve to one past the highest named-layer index, and
   what that WINS is decided in `resolve-style-and-flow`, not here -- real
   CSS: unlayered author styles beat every layered one of the same
   importance, and for `!important` lose to every one of them.

   CSS NESTING is handled BEFORE this walk, by `desugar-nesting` rewriting
   the raw text into flat rules -- so a nested rule, and a conditional
   at-rule nested inside a STYLE rule, both reach
   `scan-conditional-at-rules` as ordinary top-level ones. That is what
   lets nesting compose with `@media`/`@supports`/`@layer`/`@container` in
   both directions with no code in any of them, and it is why the
   at-rule-inside-a-style-rule simplification this docstring used to name
   is gone. The pass is a no-op on a stylesheet with no nested rule.

   Known simplification, measured rather than assumed:
   - Nested `@container` blocks keep only the INNERMOST condition. This
     engine's `@container` support is bounded to one queryable ancestor

;; for grammar it merely failed to parse -- and the difference is not a
;; nuance, it INVERTS answers. Measured in Brave 151.1.93.129 over CDP on
;; 2026-08-06, at the harness's own 756px viewport:
;;
;; | condition | Brave | old evaluator |
;; |---|---|---|
;; | `(width >= 5000px)` | black | red -- "unrecognized, so it matches" |
;; | `(min-width: 60em)` (= 960px) | black | red -- same |
;; | `not all and (min-width: 5000px)` | RED | black -- `not` was not a part it could see, so it split on `and` and the false arm decided |
;; | `(min-resolution: 1dppx)` | RED | RED -- the control: a real unknown FEATURE, where the default is right |
;;
;; So the fix is not more feature patterns, it is parsing the grammar --
;; media type, `not`/`only`, `and`/`or`, the comma list, nested parens and
;; Media Queries 4 range syntax -- and keeping the fail-open default for
;; exactly one thing: a feature NAME inside well-formed parens that this
;; engine does not implement.
;;
;; Everything else these functions do was measured on the same page. The
;; rows that shaped the code:
;;
;; | condition | Brave | why it is here |
;; |---|---|---|
;; | `(min-width: 47.25em)` | RED (= exactly 756) | `em` in a media query is 16px, NOT the root's font size -- the page declared `html { font-size: 32px }` and `(min-width: 40em)` still matched at 756 |
;; | `(min-width: 100)` | black | a unitless non-zero length is INVALID, not 100px |
;; | `(min-width: 0px)`, `(min-width: -5px)` | RED | zero needs no unit, and a negative min-width is legal and trivially true |
;; | `flurb` (bare) | black | an unknown media TYPE does not match -- unlike an unknown feature |
;; | `(min-width: 5000px), garbage garbage` | black, and the rule SURVIVES, reported back as `(min-width:5000px), not all` | an unparseable query in a comma list becomes `not all`; it does not invalidate its neighbours |
;; | `(min-width: 100px) and (flurb: 1)` | black | Brave is three-valued: unknown propagates through `and`/`or` and reads false at the top |
;; | `not (flurb: 1px)` | black | ...and through `not` too |
;;
;; The last two rows are where this engine deliberately still differs: it
;; is TWO-valued, with an unknown feature reading as true, so it answers

   `condition-fn` is always `media-condition-matches*`, threaded in as an
   ordinary higher-order argument rather than called by name: the two
   functions need each other (a media-in-parens may hold a whole nested
   condition), and this namespace does not use `declare` to paper over a
   forward reference -- the same explicit-matcher shape `matches-pseudo?`
   and `parse-calc-level` already use.

   Four shapes, all measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-06 (see the block
   comment above this section for the table):

   - a nested condition, `((min-width: 100px) and (max-width: 5000px))`;
   - `<name> : <value>` -- a plain feature. `min-width`/`max-width`/`width`
     compare against the viewport, `prefers-color-scheme` against the
     caller's scheme. A KNOWN feature carrying a value this engine cannot
     read as a length is `::invalid`, not false (Brave: `(min-width: 100)`
     does not match);
   - `<value> <op> <name>`, `<name> <op> <value>` and the two-ended
     `<value> <op> <name> <op> <value>` -- Media Queries 4 range syntax,
     which is GRAMMAR and not a feature: the old evaluator's fail-open
     default read `(width >= 5000px)` as matching, where Brave leaves it
     black;
   - `<name>` alone -- a boolean feature.

   An UNRECOGNISED feature name returns TRUE, which is this engine's
   long-standing fail-open default and the one thing this rewrite
   deliberately keeps. It is not what Brave does -- Brave is three-valued
   and answers false for `(flurb: 1px)` -- but this engine cannot tell
   \"a feature no browser has\" from \"a feature every browser has and I do
   not\", and the second is far more common in real stylesheets. The
   corpus's control for it is `(min-resolution: 1dppx)`, which is exactly
   that second case: Brave matches it, and so does this."

   false), `:nth-of-type(arg)` (`same-tag?` true, `from-end?` false),
   `:nth-last-child(arg)` (`same-tag?` false, `from-end?` true), or
   `:nth-last-of-type(arg)` (`same-tag?` true, `from-end?` true) -- resolves
   `node`'s 1-indexed position among the relevant sibling set
   (`structural-siblings`/`sibling-position`) and tests it against `arg`'s
   parsed An+B pattern (`parse-nth-expression`/`nth-matches?`, IDENTICAL
   micro-syntax and arithmetic for all four pseudo-classes -- only which
   index gets tested differs).

   `from-end?` reverses which END of the sibling set position 1 counts
   from: real CSS's `:nth-last-child`/`:nth-last-of-type` count backward
   from the LAST matching sibling instead of forward from the first. Since
   `structural-siblings` already returns the full relevant sibling set (all
   element siblings, or just same-tag ones) in document order, and
   `sibling-position` already gives `node`'s 1-indexed FORWARD position
   within it, the reverse (\"from-the-end\") position is just
   `total-siblings - forward-position + 1` -- simple arithmetic on numbers
   already in hand, needing no second, backward walk of the sibling list at
   all. E.g. among 5 siblings, forward position 5 (the last one) reverses to
   `5 - 5 + 1 = 1` (`:nth-last-child(1)` means 'the last child', matching
   real CSS), and forward position 1 (the first) reverses to
   `5 - 1 + 1 = 5`. `nth-matches?`'s own An+B arithmetic is then run against
   this reversed index exactly as it would against a forward one -- it has
   no idea, and doesn't need to know, which direction the index it was
   handed came from.

   The `of <selector-list>` clause (`nth-of-clause`, CSS Selectors 4's
   `:nth-child(2n+1 of .m)`) narrows the sibling set to the siblings that
   match that list, and additionally requires `node` itself to match it --
   both, which is what makes it different from simply writing
   `.m:nth-child(2n+1)`. Measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-05, on
   `<p class=m>1</p><p>2</p><p class=m>3</p><p>4</p>` with
   `p:nth-child(2n+1 of .m)`: only the FIRST `.m` is selected. It is the
   first `.m` among `.m`s (index 1) and would be the third among all
   children, so an engine that ignores the clause bolds both `.m`s and one
   that treats it as a plain compound bolds neither.

   `of` is valid on `:nth-child`/`:nth-last-child` only, so it is read only
   when `same-tag?` is false -- `:nth-of-type(2n of .m)` is not valid CSS
   and stays unparseable, i.e. matches nothing.

   `match-fn` is always `matches-simple?`, passed in rather than called by
   name for the same forward-reference reason `has-group-matches?` states
   for itself.

   SCOPE, stated because it is measurable: the clause's own selector goes
   through `parse-simple-selector`, so it is compound-only -- the same cut
   `:not()`/`:is()`/`:has()` already commit to -- and a selector containing
   parens (`of :not(.x)`) is not even captured, because
   `nth-pseudo-class-pattern`'s argument is a non-nested `[^()]*`. And the
   clause does NOT contribute to specificity: real CSS adds the most
   specific selector in the list, so `p:nth-child(2n+1 of .m)` should
   score (0,2,1) and scores (0,1,1) here. That only shows against a
   competing rule of exactly the intervening specificity.

   False for an unparseable `arg` or a `node` with no parent, the same
   conservative defaults their own docstrings describe."

   :selector/where, each a vector of GROUPS -- one per occurrence of that
   function on this compound, see `parse-simple-selector`'s docstring):

   - :selector/not: `node` must satisfy EVERY group (`every?`) by matching
     NONE of that group's comma-separated selectors (`not-any?`) -- e.g.
     `:not(.a, .b)` requires neither `.a` nor `.b` to match; two occurrences
     `:not(.a):not(.b)` requires both groups to independently hold, which is
     the same as requiring neither `.a` nor `.b` to match either way.
   - :selector/is / :selector/where: `node` must satisfy EVERY group by
     matching AT LEAST ONE of that group's selectors (`some`) -- :is() and
     :where() are matching-behavior IDENTICAL; they differ only in
     specificity (see `simple-selector-specificity`), never in whether they
     match.
   - :selector/has: `node` must satisfy EVERY group (`every?`, same as
     :selector/not/:selector/is above -- e.g. `:has(.a):has(.b)` requires
     BOTH occurrences to independently hold) via `has-group-matches?`, which
     itself requires at least one of that group's comma-separated relative
     selectors to match a DESCENDANT (or, for a `>`-prefixed item, a DIRECT
     CHILD) of `node` -- see the `:has()` matching section above this
     function and the namespace docstring's own `:has()` paragraph for why
     this is a fundamentally different traversal DIRECTION (downward into
     `node`'s own subtree) than every other clause in this function (upward/
     sideways via `document`).

   Each :selector/not/:selector/is/:selector/where group's selectors are
   matched via `matches-simple?` itself, recursively -- ordinary
   self-recursion (`document`/node stay the same, only the selector being
   tested changes to a simpler argument selector), not a forward reference
   to some other function defined later. :selector/has's groups are matched
   the same way, just one level removed: `has-group-matches?`/
   `has-arg-descendant-match?`/`has-arg-child-match?` take `matches-simple?`
   itself as an explicit `match-fn` argument (see the comment above those
   functions for why -- they are defined BEFORE `matches-simple?` in this
   file, so they cannot reference it by name directly without either a
   `declare` this namespace deliberately avoids, or inlining the logic here;
   passing it in as a value sidesteps both).

   Every :selector/pseudos entry is checked via `matches-pseudo?`, given
   its matching raw argument text from :selector/nth-args or
   :selector/lang-args when present (nil for every pseudo-class except
   `:nth-child`/`:nth-of-type`/`:nth-last-child`/`:nth-last-of-type`/
   `:lang` -- the two maps' keys never overlap, so `or`-ing their lookups
   together is unambiguous -- see `parse-simple-selector`). Structural
   pseudo-classes (`:first-child` and
   friends) and `:lang` alike need `document` to look up `node`'s
   parent/siblings/ancestor chain, exactly like `:focus`/`:disabled`
   already need it for other reasons -- the document-less 2-arity form
   below passes `document` nil, so those never match there either, the
   same documented restriction `matches?`'s own document-less arity
   already has. :selector/has has that identical document-less restriction
   too, for the same underlying reason (see `has-group-matches?`)."

   Measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-05, and measured rather than looked up
   because `quotes: auto` is locale-dependent and nothing in the CSS text
   names a character: the same markup was rendered twice, once with

   Depth is a property of the tree, which is why this runs in

   `no-open-quote`/`no-close-quote` move the depth and generate nothing,

   SCOPE: the depth is carried down the tree only, so a `close-quote` with

   property the user-agent stylesheet declares (where dropping the
   declaration would leave the UA value standing, and `initial` must beat
   it), plus the inherited properties (where dropping would inherit).

   Every entry measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-05 by setting the property
   to `initial` on an element inside an ancestor that declared a different
   value, and reading `getComputedStyle` back -- see `css-wide-keywords`
   for the table and the page.

   NOT here, and each for a reason that is not 'not got to yet':

   - `font-size`. Its initial value is the keyword `medium`, whose pixel
     value is keyed on the DEFAULT font of the family in use: measured
     13px on the corpus's monospace page and 16px on the same page with
     `font-family: Arial`. That is the same family-keyed table that keeps
     the absolute font-size keywords out of `resolve-font-size` (see its
     own docstring), and this engine has no font-family model to key it
     on. `font-size: initial` therefore drops, and inherits -- wrong, and
     wrong in a way that is one measurement away from being right if a
     family model ever arrives.
   - `font-family`. Its initial value is the browser's own default family,
     which is a user preference and not a CSS value at all: measured
     `\"Hiragino Kaku Gothic ProN\"` on this machine. This sheet has no
     font-family rule to beat, so `font-family: initial` drops and
     inherits -- the same cut as `font-size`, for the same missing model.
   - The uniform `:margin`/`:padding` keys this engine emits alongside the
     four longhands (see `expand-box-side-shorthand`). They are not CSS
     properties, and absence is exactly what they should say when no
     uniform value survives -- their readers already fall back.
   - `quotes` and `list-style-image`. Both inherit, so both would qualify
     under the rule below -- but nothing reads either as a style property.
     `quotes` is hardcoded at its `auto` behaviour (see `quote-marks`, and
     Brave reports `auto` for `quotes: initial`), and `list-style-image`'s
     initial value is `none`, which is what its absence already means.
   - `font-variant` (`normal`) and `font-stretch` (`100%`), measured in
     Brave 151 on 2026-08-06 alongside the rows that ARE here. Neither has
     a reader anywhere in this repo, so an entry would only add a
     `:style/*` attr nobody consumes.
   - Anything else. A property with no entry drops, which is CSS's initial
     value for every non-inherited property that the UA sheet does not
     declare. Adding an entry is only ever needed to beat the UA sheet or
     to stop an inherited property inheriting.

   The last seven rows below are the second reason, and they arrived with
   the `all` shorthand: `all: initial` on an element inside a
   `writing-mode: vertical-rl` parent reports `horizontal-tb` in Brave 151
   (2026-08-06), which only an entry here can say -- dropping the
   declaration leaves an inherited property inheriting. Measured on the one
   page, each property set to a non-initial value on the parent and to
   `initial` on the child, with an `unset` sibling beside it that reports
   the parent's value in every row and so separates the two keywords:

   `lower-entries` is the cascade entries for this same property from

   to the previous ORIGIN, and with two origins (see `ua-origin` /
   `author-origin`) an author's `revert` is 'resolve this property using
   the user-agent declarations alone'. Measured in Brave 151, 2026-08-05:
   `p.rv { margin: 0 }` with `style=\"margin: revert\"` reports 14px top
   and bottom (the UA `p { margin: 1em 0 }`) and 0 left and right (no UA
   declaration, so the initial value) -- the author rule is gone, not
   merely outranked.

   A `revert` with nothing below it degrades to `unset`, per the spec's
   own definition, and so does a `revert` inside the lowest origin -- this
   sheet has no CSS-wide keyword in it, so that branch is reachable only
   from a host that supplies its own UA rules.

   `revert-layer` takes the same `lower-entries` argument and differs only
   in WHICH entries the caller hands it: everything from a lower origin,
   plus everything in this origin that is not in the winner's own LAYER
   (`resolve-style-and-flow` assembles it). That phrasing -- \"not in this
   layer\", rather than \"in an earlier layer\" -- is what the six shapes
   measured in Brave 151 over CDP on 2026-08-06 actually say:

   | stylesheet | Brave |
   |---|---|
   | `@layer a { w:200 } @layer b { w:120; w:revert-layer }` | **200** -- the previous layer |
   | `@layer a { w:300 } @layer b { w:200 } @layer c { w:120; w:revert-layer }` | **200** -- the previous layer, not the first |
   | `@layer a { w:120; w:revert-layer }` (the only layer) | **auto** -- past the whole author origin |
   | `#x { w:120 } #x { w:revert-layer }` (no layers at all) | **auto** -- unlayered is a layer for this purpose |
   | `@layer a { w:200 } #x { w:120; w:revert-layer }` | **200** -- an unlayered `revert-layer` rolls back INTO the layers |
   | `@layer a { color:green } @layer b { w:120; w:revert-layer }` | **auto** -- the previous layer declaring nothing is not the previous layer declaring the initial value |

   Row four is why this is not simply `revert` with a layer test: with no
   `@layer` anywhere, the unlayered declarations are still a layer of their
   own and rolling back past them reaches the UA origin."

   The two are not in conflict; they are two different questions.
   `font-size: initial` is `medium`, and `medium` is keyed on the DEFAULT
   SIZE OF THE FAMILY IN USE (see `resolve-font-size`'s measured table:
   13 on a monospace page, 16 on a proportional one), so a cascade with no
   font-family model cannot answer it -- and does not. `all: initial`
   resets `font-family` in the same operation, so the family is known to be
   the initial one and `medium` has exactly one value.

   Measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-06, all four on the same

   | `all: initial` under a 30px parent       | 16px               |

   The last row is the one that says this is an absolute answer rather than
   an inherited one. `all: unset` and `all: revert` are NOT this number --
   `font-size` inherits, so both report the parent's 14px and 30px
   respectively, which the ordinary keyword resolution already gives.

   What is still missing is `font-family` itself: this cascade has no
   family model, so `all: initial` cannot write the initial family and the
   element keeps whatever family it was drawn in. That is the whole of what
   `:cascade/all-initial-resets-every-property` still diverges by, and it
   is NOT the font size -- both sides say 16. It is the two things the

   | advance of `a` at 16px            | 9.2            | 9.6 (est) |

   so the case reports an 800x21 line box against Brave's 800x24, and the
   letter at y=1.3 against y=4. The width is inside the geometry axis's 2px

   expanded into its longhands -- so the only question is which longhands
   are worth writing. The answer is different per keyword, and each part is
   here for a reason rather than for completeness:

   - **Everything anyone declared for this element** (`declared`). This is
     what makes `all` beat the author's own earlier `width: 120px` and the
     UA sheet's `p { margin: 1em 0 }`; without it `all` would only ever
     touch properties it happened to know the name of. `sorted` already
     holds the UA, author and inline entries together, which is exactly the
     set of properties `all` has something to override.

   - **`initial-values`**, because those are precisely the properties whose
     initial value is NOT the same as absence in this engine's
     representation. A property outside that map computes its initial value
     by having no entry at all, so expanding into it would write nothing.

   - **`inherited-properties`**, because for those, absence means *inherit*
     -- so `all: initial` has to be present to stop the inheritance even
     when nobody declared the property anywhere.

   - **The parent's own resolved properties**, and ONLY for `inherit`.
     `all: inherit` copies the parent's whole computed style, including
     properties this element has never heard of: measured in Brave 151,
     2026-08-06, a `<div>` with `all: inherit` inside a
     `color: purple; width: 300px` parent reports width 300px and purple.
     The other three keywords do not need this -- they resolve from this
     element's own cascade -- and reading the parent for them would be a
     larger working set for no answer.

   For `initial` and `unset` that list is provably complete: a property
   outside all three sets is one that nothing declared and whose initial
   value is absence, which is already what it computes. For `revert` it is
   complete for a different reason -- `revert` rolls back to the UA origin,
   and every UA declaration for this element is in `sorted`."

  "Replaces every `all` entry in the already-sorted cascade entry list with
   one clone per property in `all-shorthand-universe`, each carrying the
   `all` entry's own origin, specificity, layer, importance and position.

   Expanding HERE rather than in `parse-declarations-with-importance`, where
   every other shorthand is expanded, is the whole design: `all`'s longhand
   set is not a property of the declaration, it is a property of the
   element's finished cascade (see `all-shorthand-universe`), and a
   declaration parser sees one block. Expanding into the sorted list gets
   the cascade semantics for free rather than by restating them -- each
   clone sorts exactly where `all` sorted, so `group-by` hands the winner
   of each property the same entry it would have handed a hand-written
   longhand in `all`'s place. All four of these were measured in Brave 151
   on 2026-08-06 and all four fall out of that with no code of their own:

   | shape                                                      | width |
   |------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
   | `#a { width: 120px; all: initial }`                        | auto  |
   | `#a { all: initial; width: 120px }`                        | 120px |
   | `#a { all: initial } #a { width: 120px }`                  | 120px |
   | `div#a { width: 120px } #a { all: initial }`                | 120px |
   | `#a { all: initial !important } #a { width: 120px }`       | auto  |
   | `#a { all: initial } #a { width: 120px !important }`       | 120px |

   The fourth is the one that would have been wrong under any 'reset then
   re-apply' reading: the higher-specificity `width` wins even though it is
   written first, because `all` is a normal declaration and not a phase.

   A value that is not a CSS-wide keyword makes the whole declaration
   invalid and it is dropped (`#s { all: 5px }` leaves an 800x20 block in
   Brave), which is why the non-keyword branch emits nothing rather than
   passing the entry through -- letting it through would write
   `:style/all` onto the element for nobody to read."

;; ---- the user-agent stylesheet ----
;;
;; A browser's cascade has THREE origins -- user-agent, author, inline --
;; and until now this one had only the last two. The UA origin's knowledge
;; lived in `cssom.layout`, as a column of `(or (style node :x) <ua
;; default>)` fallbacks and half a dozen tag->value tables beside them, so
;; the cascade never wrote those values and `computed-style` reported
;; `display: inline` for a `<div>`, weight 400 for a `<b>` and black for a
;; link. Layout was right; everyone who ASKED was told something false --
;; devtools, an accessibility projection, a `getComputedStyle`-compatible
;; API, a script that branches on style. Measured against a real browser by
;; the conformance harness on 2026-08-05: 2,260 of 2,315 computed-style
;; mismatches were that one architectural fact repeated, and the genuinely
;; cascade-attributed residual behind them was NINE values. See
;; ADR-2800003100.
;;
;; It is CSS text rather than a tag->value map on purpose. Real UA rules
;; are not keyed on the tag alone and pretending they are is the trap this
;; measurement walked into first: an `<a>` is blue only when it HAS an
;; `href` (Chrome's own rule is `a:-webkit-any-link`, and a bare `<a>`
;; measures ZERO non-initial properties), an `<input>`'s box depends
;; entirely on its `type`, and `[hidden]` is an attribute rule that applies
;; to every element there is. Written as CSS, `parse-rules` and `matches?`
;; -- the same selector engine an author's stylesheet goes through --
;; express all three directly, and specificity orders `input[type=...]`
;; over `input` for free.

(def ^:private ua-stylesheet-text
  "The user-agent stylesheet, as CSS.

   SCOPE, stated exactly, because what is NOT here matters as much as what
   is. The sheet landed in two halves. The first carried every UA
   declaration whose value is an ABSOLUTE length or a keyword. The second
   -- `p { margin: 1em 0 }`, `h1 { font-size: 2em }`, a `<fieldset>`'s
   `padding: 0.35em 0.75em 0.625em`, `small { font-size: smaller }` -- had
   to wait for the cascade to be able to resolve a length at all, because
   `em` resolves against the element's OWN computed font size and this
   cascade used to store whatever the author declared without ever
   computing one. `resolve-relative-lengths` is that step, and those rules
   are now here with the rest; `cssom.layout`'s `ua-margin-scale` /
   `ua-font-scale` / `ua-em-box` are gone.

   Deliberately absent, each for a reason that is not 'not got to yet':

   - `display: none` for `<head>`/`<script>`/`<style>`/... . `cssom.layout`
     suppresses those by tag (`non-rendered-tags`) BEFORE it looks at
     `display` at all, and the set of tags a real UA hides is wider than
     the set this engine renders -- writing the rule would change what
     `<datalist>`/`<source>`/`<track>` lay out, which is a rendering change
     wearing a cascade change's clothes. `[hidden]` IS here: that one is
     already spelled in `node-style`, as an attribute rule, and moving it
     is a move rather than a new rule.
   - the ABSOLUTE font-size keywords. Chrome's real sheet says
     `pre { font-family: monospace; font-size: -webkit-xxx-large }`-style
     things whose value comes out of a table keyed on the default font of
     the family in use (measured: `font-size: medium` is 13px on a
     monospace page and 16 on a proportional one). `smaller`/`larger` ARE
     here, on `<small>`/`<sub>`/`<sup>`, because they are a plain ratio
     off the parent (see `font-size-scale-step`) and need no such table.
   - `<select>`'s block padding. `cssom.layout`'s `ua-control-box` gives it
     1px top and bottom, and a browser reports `padding: 0px` -- the 1px is
     this engine's expression of Chrome's own internal button padding,
     measured as a constant +4px of height at every font size (see that
     table's docstring). It is a box constant with no `getComputedStyle`
     counterpart, so writing it into the cascade would make the reported
     value WRONG to make a box right.
   - `text-align: center` on `<th>`/`<button>` and `-webkit-center` on
     `<caption>`. Real, and this engine has neither -- so they are new UA
     knowledge, not a move. Landed separately, measured against geometry.

   Values are the ones `cssom.layout` already used, which are themselves
   readings off `getComputedStyle` in Brave 151 (see each table's docstring
   there for the measurement). Where the browser and this engine differed,
   the ENGINE's value was written when the sheet's first half landed: that
   change moved where a value comes from, not what it is. The one place
   that left a knowingly-wrong number -- `<input type=radio>`, given a
   CHECKBOX's `3px 3px 3px 4px` where a browser measures `3px 3px 0 5px`
   -- is corrected here, re-measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-05, because
   the second half moves boxes anyway and a 4-value residual charged to
   the cascade is not worth carrying to look tidy.

   The `margin`/`padding` SHORTHAND is used only where the uniform value it
   also emits (see expand-box-side-shorthand) is the one this engine's
   uniform `:padding`/`:margin` reader should see. `input`/`button` state
   their four sides as longhands for exactly that reason: their shorthand's
   first token is the 1px BLOCK padding, and letting it land on the uniform
   key would narrow every text field by the difference.

   The measurements that travelled here with the rules, from the tables in
   `cssom.layout` these replace -- each one is why a rule is here rather
   than a plausible-looking guess:

   - `td, th { padding: 1px }`: without it every table cell was 2px short
     in each axis, which the conformance harness's geometry axis reported
     as `td` 6/29.
   - `figure { margin: 1em 40px }`: only the 1em half of it used to exist
     (the vertical margin was in `ua-margin-scale` from the start while the
     40px indent was nowhere), so a `<figure>` sat flush against its
     article's content edge and was 80px too wide. Measured in Brave 151,
     2026-08-05, on `:page/article-with-figure`'s own 300px article: the
     browser puts the figure at x=40 with w=220 and this engine had x=0,
     w=300, which the figure's `<img>` and `<figcaption>` then inherited
     box for box -- six numbers from one missing declaration.
   - `menu`/`dir` carry `<ul>`'s 40px indent and `display: block` because
     they are the legacy list containers and are in Chrome's own rule.
     Measured 2026-08-05 on a bare `<menu><li>a</li></menu>`:
     `margin-block: 16px`, `padding-left: 40px`.
   - `b, strong, th, h1..h6 { font-weight: bold }`: authors do not write
     `b { font-weight: bold }`, the UA does, and without it `<b>`,
     `<strong>`, `<th>` and every heading rendered in NORMAL weight.
   - `sub { vertical-align: sub }` / `sup { vertical-align: super }`: an
     author writes `<sub>`, never the declaration, so without them a
     subscript and a superscript sat on the same baseline as the text
     around them -- the entire visual point of both tags.
   - `table { border-spacing: 2px }` is keyed on the TAG, not on being a
     table: real CSS's initial value is 0, and measured in Brave a
     `<div style=\"display:table\">` reports `border-spacing: 0px` where
     `<table>` reports 2px. Defaulting every table-displayed box to 2 put
     phantom spacing into every CSS-declared table.
   - The `:disabled` colours, measured in Brave 151 on 2026-08-05 by
     putting every control in the page twice, once bare and once
     `disabled`, and reading `color` back. There are THREE of them, not
     one, and which one applies is keyed on the control's `type`:

       input, textarea                                rgb(84, 84, 84)
       button, input type=button/submit/reset/color   rgba(16, 16, 16, .3)
       select                                         rgb(128, 128, 128)

     `:disabled` and not `[disabled]`: an `<input>` inside a
     `<fieldset disabled>` reports the same grey with no attribute of its
     own, which is exactly what `disabled-control?` already computes.
     `readonly` is NOT this -- a readonly input reports plain black -- and
     neither is `disabled` on a non-control (a `<p disabled>` is black).
     `input[type=\"range\"]:disabled` measures rgb(197, 197, 197) and is
     deliberately absent: the range control has no text to colour here and
     this engine draws no track, so the value would be unobservable.

     What is deliberately NOT here, though it was measured at the same
     time: the ENABLED control colours. An `<input>` inside a
     `color: #ff0000` div reports BLACK in a browser -- a control does not
     inherit the page's colour -- and this engine inherits it. Writing
     `input, textarea, select { color: #000000 }` would fix that and would
     also hard-code black into every host theme that renders through this
     cascade, including the dark one `cssom.layout`'s own theme draws (the
     conformance corpus paints its text `#e6ebf5`). The real UA value is
     the system colour `fieldtext`, and this sheet has no system-colour
     model; landing it needs one, not a hex constant.

   - `[hidden] { display: none }` is attribute PRESENCE and does not look
     at the value. Measured in Brave 151, 2026-08-05: `hidden=\"false\"`,
     `hidden=\"\"` and `hidden=\"hidden\"` all report `display: none` and
     `offsetHeight: 0`, against a bare `<div>`'s `block`/24.

   And the `em`-relative half, every number of it re-measured in Brave 151
   on 2026-08-05 inside a 14px page (which is what makes the ratios
   readable: an `<h5>` reports font-size 11.62 and margin 19.4054, i.e.
   0.83 and 1.67 exactly, and 1.67 of its OWN 11.62 rather than of the
   page's 14):

   - `h1..h6`: font-size 2 / 1.5 / 1.17 / 1 / 0.83 / 0.67 em, margin-block
     0.67 / 0.83 / 1 / 1.33 / 1.67 / 2.33 em. `h4`'s `font-size: 1em` is
     not written: it is the inherited size by definition, and writing it
     would turn an inherited value into a declared one for no effect.
   - `p, blockquote, dl, pre, figure, ul, ol, menu, dir { margin-block:
     1em }` and `hr { margin-block: 0.5em }`.
   - `:is(ul, ol, menu, dir) :is(ul, ol, menu, dir) { margin-block: 0 }`,
     spelled out as sixteen descendant selectors because this sheet's
     matching stays inside the plain-selector subset. Chrome's own rule is
     the `:is()` form. This is the ONE rule here with a combinator, and it
     is why `ua-style-of` has a no-document branch -- see there.
   - `small, sub, sup { font-size: smaller }`. This engine used to say
     `0.83em`, close enough to survive the harness's tolerance (11.62
     against the browser's 11.6667) but not the same rule; `smaller` is
     what a UA sheet actually says and it is exactly 1/1.2.
   - `fieldset { padding: 0.35em 0.75em 0.625em }`, as longhands for the
     reason stated above -- measured 4.9 / 10.5 / 8.75 at 14px and
     7 / 15 / 12.5 at 20px, which is what separates the em terms from the
     px ones.
   - `button, input, select, textarea { font-size: 13.3333px }`. Not `em`
     at all, and the reason it is in this half rather than the first is
     that it needed the same machinery: a control's UA font is an absolute
     13.3333px in every browser (an `<input>` inside a `font-size: 30px`
     div still measures 13.3333), and until `resolve-relative-lengths`
     normalised a fractional length to a number, writing it here would
     have handed `cssom.layout` the string \"13.3333px\" where it wants a
     number. The FAMILY that goes with it (Arial, monospace for
     `<textarea>`) stays in `cssom.layout`'s `ua-control-font` -- this
     sheet has no font-family rule at all and adding one is a separate
     measurement.
   - `input[type=\"radio\"]`'s own margins, `3px 3px 0 5px`, split out of
     the checkbox rule they were wrongly sharing.
   - `progress { width: 10em; height: 1em }` and
     `meter { width: 5em; height: 1em }`, plus
     `progress, meter { display: inline-block; box-sizing: border-box;
     vertical-align: -0.2em }`. Both tags used to be in `cssom.layout`'s
     `inline-level-tags` -- text-like inlines with no box of their own --
     and laid out as 400x0 blocks. The `inline-block` half was written
     down here as deliberately ABSENT until 2026-08-06, on the grounds
     that acting on it \"would silently rewrite how they flow, which is a
     layout decision needing its own measurement\". This is that
     measurement, in Brave 151, and every number of it is `em`:

       font-size    progress      meter
       8px           80x8         40x8
       14px         140x14        70x14
       28px         280x28       140x28

     i.e. `10em x 1em` and `5em x 1em` exactly, which is why these are
     stylesheet rules and not the platform constants a 140 and a 70 would
     otherwise look like. `box-sizing: border-box` and `display:
     inline-block` are read straight off `getComputedStyle`; the
     `-0.2em` is the 2.797px both sit BELOW the baseline at 14px (5.594 at
     28px, and 0 change under `line-height: 10px`/`40px`, which is what
     rules out a leading-derived explanation). Their flow is measured too:
     `x <progress></progress> y` is ONE 20px line in Brave with the bar at
     x=14, where the block treatment gave three rows.
   - `input[type=\"range\"|\"color\"|\"file\"]`. All three used to come out
     of the plain `input` rule at a text field's 153x21 with its 1px/2px
     padding and 2px border, and none of them is a text field. Measured in
     Brave 151 on 2026-08-06, at `font-size` 8, 14, 28 and 40 -- none of
     these numbers moves with the font, which is what says they are
     platform WIDGETS and not boxes derived from a face:

       range   129x16, `margin: 2px`, no padding, no border, content-box
       color   50x27, `border: 1px`, the text field's 1px/2px padding,
               border-box
       file    ...x27, no padding, no border, content-box

     The `...` is not an omission, it is the scope cut, and it is here
     rather than in a comment because the number is the interesting part:
     Brave says **253**, and 253 is not a platform constant. It is the
     width of a shadow-DOM `<button>` holding the browser's own localized
     \"Choose File\" string plus a reserved filename column. Measured on
     the same page: that button is 87.141 wide and \"No file chosen\" in
     the UA control face is 84.484, which sum to 171.625 -- 81 short of
     253 -- so the control also reserves a fixed filename column this
     engine has no way to derive, and both halves are en-US strings that a
     browser in another locale renders at a different width. A 253 written
     down here would be a measurement of this machine's UI language. The
     HEIGHT is a rule and is written: 27 is the engine's own 21px
     `<button>` with 3px above and below it, which is also where the
     control's baseline comes from (see `ua-control-baseline` in
     `cssom.layout`).
   - `iframe { border: 2px inset }`, which is the entire difference
     between an `<iframe>` and a `<video>`: measured in Brave 151 on
     2026-08-06 both reserve a 300x150 CONTENT box, and the iframe reports
     304x154 because of this one declaration -- `border: 0` on the same
     iframe gives 300x150 exactly. The `inset` STYLE is not modelled (this
     engine draws one solid border, the same reading `<hr>` already
     carries in `cssom.layout`'s `ua-tag-box`), so the style is written
     for what it is and the paint is a solid hairline.
   - `dialog`'s `padding: 1em` and `border: solid`, measured in Brave 151
     on 2026-08-05: `padding` 14px on all four sides at this page's 14px,
     `border-top-width` 3px (`solid`'s `medium`), `border-top-style`
     solid. Written as four padding longhands, like `fieldset`, because
     `padding: 1em` is not a length at declaration time and
     `expand-box-side-shorthand` correctly declines to expand it -- which
     leaves ONLY the uniform key, and everything that reads a per-side
     padding (including `getComputedStyle`) then sees nothing. Together
     these make the box exact in one dimension: Brave reports
     `<dialog open>Hi</dialog>` as 48x54 and this engine drew 300x20,
     which is now 300x54.

     And the REST of `dialog`'s UA rule, written on 2026-08-06 once
     `cssom.layout` could resolve `fit-content`: `position: absolute;
     left: 0; right: 0; width: fit-content; height: fit-content;
     margin: auto`. It was measured a round earlier and deliberately left
     out then, because adding it would have moved the numbers without
     converging on them -- and that was measured too: with the
     declarations added and `fit-content` still behaving as `auto`, NOT
     ONE BOX MOVED. The box stayed 300 wide, so the leftover space the
     auto margins are supposed to split was zero.

     Re-measured in Brave 151 over CDP on 2026-08-06, `<dialog open>Hi
     </dialog>` inside a 300px `position: relative` parent: the box is
     48x54 at x=126, `getComputedStyle` reports `width: 14px` (the
     fit-content size of `Hi`), `height: 20px`, `margin: 0px 126px` --
     i.e. `(300 - 48) / 2` on each inline side and ZERO on the block
     sides -- `left: 0px`, `right: 0px`, and `top` resolved to the box's
     own STATIC position, which is what says `top` is `auto` in the UA
     sheet and only the inline insets are written. Confirmed by moving
     the same dialog into a case with no positioned ancestor: it centres
     in the 756px viewport (x=354) and its `top` reads back as that
     case's own offset down the page (124px), which no declared `top`
     could produce.

     Written as four `margin-*` longhands for the same reason the padding
     is: `auto` is not a length, so expand-box-side-shorthand correctly
     declines to expand `margin: auto`, and everything that reads a
     per-side margin -- `auto-margin?` in `cssom.layout`, and
     `getComputedStyle` -- would then see nothing.

     Measured but NOT written, because neither changes a box or any of
     the fourteen properties the computed-style axis compares:
     `background-color: rgb(255,255,255)` and `color: rgb(0,0,0)`. This
     engine's default page is dark, so writing them would repaint every
     dialog white on a surface nothing else in the corpus can judge."

;;     a 28px div, `font-size: 1rem` reports 16px on a page whose <html> is
;;     the browser default.
;;   - a percentage font-size is the parent's size (`150%` of 14 -> 21,

;;     the containing BLOCK's, not a font size at all (`margin-top: 50%`
;;     in an 800px box measured 400px) -- so percentages are resolved here
;;     for `font-size` and left completely alone everywhere else.

   14, which is NOT CSS's own initial `font-size: medium` (16 in every
   browser) and is chosen against it deliberately. `1em` has exactly one
   honest meaning -- the size of the text this engine actually DRAWS -- and
   that size is `cssom.layout/default-theme`'s, which is 14. Defaulting to
   16 here was tried first and is what a spec reading argues for; it
   produced a document whose bare `<p>` was given 16px margins around 14px
   text, and 42 of this repo's own layout tests said so immediately. A
   number that disagrees with the renderer beside it is not more correct
   for matching a spec that assumed a different renderer.

   So the number is defined HERE and `cssom.layout/default-theme` reads it,
   rather than the two agreeing by coincidence -- the same rule that put
   the UA stylesheet in one place (ADR-2800003100). A host that draws at
   another size must pass BOTH a `:theme` with its `:font-size` and this
   opt with the same number; passing one without the other is precisely the
   drift this arrangement exists to make visible.

   What it costs a caller who supplies nothing: a document that declares no
   font-size anywhere reports `margin-top: 14px` on a bare `<p>` where a
   browser reports 16. The moment ANY ancestor declares a size -- which

   Three things read off it. It is not a ratio -- 16/13 is not 18/16, so
   the two columns are two ROWS of a table and not one row scaled. It is
   keyed on the family's default SIZE and not on the family: `Arial` and
   `serif` produce byte-identical columns, and both differ from
   `monospace` only because Chrome's default fixed size is 13 where its
   default proportional size is 16. And the starred entries are the one
   place the reported value and the value `em` resolves against DISAGREE:
   `xx-small` reports 10px in every family while the same element's
   `margin: 1em` measures 9, so the row's own value is 9 and something
   clamps only the reported one. Anything built on this table should
   assert against the margin, not against the reported size.

   What a fix needs beyond the table is a font-family model: the row is
   chosen by the family's default size, so `font-family` has to reach the
   cascade first. This engine's sheet has no font-family rule at all (see
   `ua-stylesheet-text`'s note on the control font, which is the same
   gap). Until then the corpus's own `:text/font-size-absolute-keyword`
   stays divergent -- and its cost is not the font size, which the
   harness excludes as non-absolute, but the UA `p { margin: 1em 0 }`
   underneath it, which then resolves against 14 instead of 16."

;; a live page's `getComputedStyle` -- reporting nothing at all, exactly
;; the architectural mistake ADR-2800003100 corrected for the UA sheet.
;;
;; WHICH DIRECTION IT READS. The element's OWN computed direction, not its
;; containing block's. Measured: `<div style="width:300px"><div
;; style="direction:rtl; margin-inline:20px 60px">` puts the inner box at
;; x=60 -- the same answer as declaring `direction: rtl` on the PARENT and
;; inheriting it. Both were measured, side by side, because they are
;; indistinguishable in every case where only the parent declares it.
;;
;; HOW IT COMPETES WITH THE PHYSICAL PROPERTY. A logical and a physical
;; longhand that land on the same side are two declarations for ONE slot,
;; resolved by the ordinary cascade -- so within one declaration block,
;; SOURCE ORDER decides. Measured, all four combinations:
;;
;;   margin-left: 5px; margin-inline-start: 40px   -> marginLeft 40px
;;   margin-inline-start: 40px; margin-left: 5px   -> marginLeft  5px

;;   margin-inline-start: 40px; margin: 1px        -> marginLeft  1px
;;
;; and, decisively, the same first pair under `direction: rtl` gives
;; marginLeft 5px / marginRight 40px in BOTH orders -- because there the
;; two declarations no longer collide. The collision is therefore decided
;; AFTER the rename, not before, which is exactly what `resolve-style-for`
;; does: it renames each declaration in the already-sorted cascade list and
;; lets its existing "last entry of the group wins" step pick between them.
;; Nothing about ordering had to be added.

;; asks the engine itself, in the two places the engine's own knowledge
;; actually lives -- which are not the same place for the property and for
;; the value.
;;
;; Before this, `parse-rules` did not recognise the at-rule at all, the
;; plain `selector { decls }` reader picked its inner rules up as if the
;; wrapper were not there, and every `@supports` block therefore applied
;; UNCONDITIONALLY. Measured in Brave 151.1.93.129 over CDP on 2026-08-06,
;; that is right half the time:
;;
;; | condition | Brave | this engine, before |
;; |---|---|---|
;; | `(display: grid)` | red | red -- but only because it applies everything |
;; | `(display: flurb)` | black | red |
;; | `(flurb: 1px)` | black | red |
;; | `not (display: grid)` | black | red |
;; | `(display: grid) and (display: flurb)` | black | red |
;; | `(display: flurb) or (display: grid)` | red | red |
;; | `selector(p:has(b))` | red | red |
;; | `selector(:frobnicate)` | black | red |
;;
;; The same page measured the two things a `@supports` evaluator has to get
;; right beyond the declarations themselves, and they are NOT the same
;; answer:
;;
;; - A `<general-enclosed>` -- something well-formed that the UA does not
;;   understand, i.e. `(grid)` or `frobnicate(x)` -- is FALSE, and `not`
;;   inverts it: `@supports (grid)` is black and `@supports not (grid)` is
;;   RED. Same for the function form.
;; - A condition that does not PARSE at all -- `garbage`, an unparenthesised
;;   `display: grid`, or `(display: grid) or garbage` -- makes the whole
;;   at-rule invalid, and the browser drops it: all four came back black,
;;   AND `not garbage` came back black too, where `not (grid)` was red.
;;   Reading `document.styleSheets[0].cssRules` confirmed it: 44 `@supports`
;;   rules were written and 40 survived, the four missing ones being exactly
;;   those. So "unparseable" is not "false" -- a `not` can rescue a false
;;   condition and cannot rescue an unparseable one, which is why
;;   `supports-condition-matches?` below returns a third value for it.
;;
;; The two rows this section used to name as a scope cut were
;; `(color: #zzz)` and `(text-decoration: flurb)`, both black in Brave and
;; both true here, and the reason given was that "the colour grammar and
;; the text-decoration grammar live in `cssom.layout`", which requires
;; `cssom.core` and so cannot be asked. THAT PREMISE WAS WRONG, and finding
;; out where those grammars actually live is what closed both rows:
;;
;;   * `cssom.layout` does not parse a colour ANYWHERE. It threads the
;;     author's string straight onto the draw-op. The only colour parser
;;     this engine has is `kotoba.wasm.host.color/parse-color`, one layer
;;     BELOW this namespace -- in the same dependency `kotoba.wasm.dom`
;;     comes from. So the colour half needed a `require`, not a move, not a
;;     mirror and not a gate: see the `ns` form and `color-value-support`.
;;
;;   * `cssom.layout` does not enumerate `text-decoration` either. The
;;     three line keywords it draws live in dom-gpu's `.cljs` RENDERERS
;;     (`kotoba.wasm.host.webgpu/draw-text-decoration!` and its webgl
;;     twin), which a `.cljc` namespace cannot require without breaking the
;;     JVM path. That one is a real copy -- `text-decoration-line-keywords`
;;     below -- and it carries the gate the copy needs.
;;
;; 115 conditions were read out of Brave on 2026-08-06, one probe page per
;; probe, and 35 of them are the colour and text-decoration rows above,
;; which now agree exactly. THIRTY are left, every one of them fail-OPEN
;; (black in Brave, true here) and every one of them written down so the
;; next round starts from the browser rather than from the spec:

;;                                    each of these needs its own keyword

;; and THREE where the fail-open default is RIGHT, and an enumeration would
;; have broken them -- Brave says these ARE supported, because their value
;; space genuinely admits an arbitrary identifier:
;;
;;   (font-family: flurb)  (list-style-type: flurb)  (will-change: flurb)
;;
;; That last group is the reason closing the other thirty means writing a

(defn- resolve-style-and-flow
  "Cascade-resolves the declarations that target `pseudo-element` (nil for
   the real element itself, :before/:after for its generated content) on
   `node`. Mirrors the pre-pseudo-element `computed-style` algorithm exactly
   when `pseudo-element` is nil, so existing behavior is unchanged.

   Cascade layers: each rule-based entry carries its :rule/layer-priority
   (see `parse-rules`) as :layer, and the sort tuple below checks :layer
   *before* :specificity -- so layer membership decides first, specificity
   only breaks ties within the same layer, exactly like real CSS cascade
   layers.

   `!important` layer-order reversal (CSS Cascading and Inheritance Level 5,
   the importance/cascade-origin step): for normal (non-`!important`)
   declarations, a later-declared layer beats an earlier one -- :layer sorts
   ascending and the last-sorted entry wins, so a higher :rule/layer-priority
   (later-declared layer) naturally wins. For `!important` declarations, real
   CSS *reverses* that: an earlier-declared layer beats a later one. Each
   entry's :layer value is negated when that entry's own :important? is true
   (see the `if important? (- raw-layer) raw-layer` below) so a lower
   :rule/layer-priority (earlier-declared layer) sorts *last* -- and wins --
   within the important group, while the non-important group is untouched.
   This negation is safe because: (1) it is keyed off each entry's own
   :important?, and :important? is compared *before* :layer in the tuple, so
   two entries only ever reach the :layer comparison once they've already
   tied on :important? -- meaning both sides use the same sign, never mixed;
   (2) negation is a strictly order-reversing map, so it flips relative order
   between different layers but leaves within-layer ties (same raw value,
   same sign) exactly as ties, falling through to :specificity/:order
   unaffected -- \"specificity/order tie-breaking within a layer\" is
   unchanged, as required.

   Unlayered-beats-layered is encoded as a \"one past the highest layer
   index\" sentinel riding on :layer's own numeric magnitude -- unlayered
   entries get `(inc max-layer-priority)` as their raw layer value instead
   of a real `:rule/layer-priority`, guaranteeing it sorts after every real
   layer for NORMAL declarations (a plain `(sort-by :layer ...)` already
   picks the highest number). Crucially, this sentinel is subject to the
   *exact same* `(if important? (- raw-layer) raw-layer)` negation every
   real layer value already gets -- there is no separate :unlayered?
   dimension to keep in sync. Negation preserves relative order across the
   WHOLE numeric range uniformly, sentinel included: `-(max+1)` is smaller
   than `-real-layer` for every real layer `<= max`, so for `!important`
   declarations the sentinel sorts *first* (lowest priority) among the
   important group -- meaning an unlayered `!important` declaration
   correctly LOSES to every layered `!important` declaration, exactly
   matching real CSS's own well-documented (if unintuitive) importance-
   reversal behavior: `!important` doesn't just reverse layer order among
   layers, it also flips unlayered from \"wins over everything\" to \"loses
   to everything layered.\" An earlier, since-corrected version of this
   function used a separate :unlayered? boolean compared *before* :layer
   specifically to avoid this reversal (reasoning that the sentinel would
   need its own \"reversal-proofing\") -- that reasoning was itself the bug:
   a plain arithmetic sentinel *already* reverses correctly under the same
   negation every other layer value uses, and the separate-boolean
   approach instead pinned unlayered `!important` as an unconditional
   winner, which both an author's real Chrome/Firefox and the CSS
   Cascading and Inheritance Level 5 spec disagree with. Confirmed via
   direct REPL reproduction before touching source: `@layer a { #hero {
   color: red !important } } @layer b { #hero { color: blue !important }
   } div#hero { color: green !important }` resolved to `green` (unlayered)
   instead of the spec-correct `red` (layer `a`, the earliest-declared
   layer, since importance reverses layer order too, and both layered
   rules beat the unlayered one).

   Inline declarations have no layer concept in real CSS; per the Level 5
   spec they are treated like an unlayered declaration for cascade-layer
   purposes, and (like any unlayered declaration) always win over a layered
   rule-based declaration of the same importance -- but see the paragraph
   above: for `!important` specifically, inline is EXEMPT from the
   unlayered-loses-to-layered reversal precisely because :inline? sits
   *above* :layer in the sort tuple, so once :important? ties, a difference
   in :inline? decides the comparison and :layer (sentinel value and its
   negation both) is never consulted at all -- inline's own :layer value is
   inert for correctness (set to the stylesheet's highest resolved layer
   priority, purely for documentation). This matches real CSS: an inline
   `style=\"... !important\"` declaration beats even a layered `!important`
   rule, unlike a plain unlayered `!important` rule-based declaration.

   Inline `!important` (real, common CSS -- e.g. `style=\"color: red
   !important\"`, routinely used to override a stubborn rule-based style):
   :important? above is real per-property importance, from
   `inline-style-importance` (a SEPARATE accessor reading a SEPARATE
   `:style-inline-important` attr -- a set of property keywords -- rather
   than changing `inline-style`/`:style-inline`'s own `{property value}`
   shape, since that shape has real consumers elsewhere, e.g.
   kotoba-lang/browser's `dom_bridge.cljc`, that must not be disturbed).
   `kotoba-lang/htmldom` (`htmldom.core/parse-style` + the new
   `htmldom.core/style-importance`, both called from `apply-attrs`)
   populates both attrs outside this namespace. Before this, `!important`
   wasn't just unranked here -- `htmldom.core/parse-style` didn't even
   STRIP the literal `!important` suffix from the value, so an
   `!important`-marked inline declaration's value was genuinely corrupted
   (e.g. `:color \"red !important\"`, which no downstream color parser
   recognizes as `\"red\"`) and silently fell back to that property's own
   unstyled/transparent default -- a real, visible rendering bug, not
   merely a cascade-ordering nicety.

   `content: attr(name)` resolution: a `content` declaration's raw value may
   parse (see `parse-content-value`) not to a plain string but to an attr()
   reference marker (or a marker holding a mix of string-literal and attr()
   terms) -- its actual text isn't known until the winning declaration for
   *this specific* `node` is resolved, since attr()'s value is that node's
   own real HTML attribute value, not anything the stylesheet text itself
   carries. `node` here is always the *originating* real element regardless
   of whether `pseudo-element` is nil or :before/:after (`computed-style`/
   `pseudo-element-style-for` always pass the real element in, never a
   synthetic pseudo-element node -- kotoba.wasm.dom has no such node concept,
   see the namespace docstring), which is exactly attr()'s real-CSS target:
   it always reads the attribute off the element the pseudo-element is
   generated FOR. So once the cascade above has picked this node's winning
   `content` declaration, `resolve-content-value` resolves any attr()
   reference(s) in it against `node`'s own :attrs immediately below, before
   returning -- a missing attribute resolves to `\"\"` (real CSS behavior:
   attr() on an absent attribute is an empty string, not \"no content\"),
   matching how `content: \"\"` already behaves. Every other property, and
   every already-a-plain-string `content` value, passes through this step
   unaffected.

   `content: counter(name)` resolution -- the 5-arity form's `counters`
   argument: unlike attr(), a counter() reference cannot be resolved from
   `node` alone (see the namespace docstring and `parse-content-counter-ref`
   for why: a counter's value is the cumulative effect of every
   counter-reset/counter-increment declaration on every element preceding
   this point in document tree order). So this function accepts an
   additional, OPTIONAL `counters` argument -- the running named-counter map
   as of this exact point in a real top-down tree walk, which only
   `apply-cascade` can honestly build and thread (see its docstring and
   `style-with-counters`). The 4-arity form (used by `computed-style` and
   `pseudo-element-style-for`, i.e. every standalone, non-apply-cascade
   caller) implicitly passes `counters` nil, meaning \"no real tree-walk
   context exists\" -- `resolve-content-value` then honestly leaves any
   counter() reference unresolved (dropping :content entirely, same as any
   other unsupported form) rather than fabricating a number. This is a real,
   documented limitation of calling `computed-style`/`pseudo-element-style-for`
   outside `apply-cascade`, not a bug.

   `@container` matching -- the 6-arity form's `container-ctx` argument:
   any rule carrying `:rule/container` (see `parse-rules`) additionally
   needs `container-rule-matches?` to pass, given `node`'s own
   :node/id and `container-ctx` (nil by default, same treatment as
   `counters` above and for the same reason -- see
   `container-rule-matches?`'s own docstring for exactly which callers ever
   have a real one: only `apply-cascade`'s own second pass, never
   `computed-style`/`pseudo-element-style-for`, and never apply-cascade's
   own FIRST pass either, which must not let any @container rule contribute
   before container widths are even known).

   The CSS-wide keywords -- `inherit`, `initial`, `unset`, `revert` (see
   `css-wide-keywords` for the browser measurements that separate them,
   and `resolve-css-wide-keyword` for the resolution): a winning
   declaration whose value is one of the four never reaches the resulting
   map as the literal string. Storing it verbatim was a real bug -- an
   extremely common author idiom, `color: inherit`, silently rendered
   fully transparent/invisible text downstream, since no color parser
   recognizes the word \"inherit\" as a color -- and the same was true of
   the other three until 2026-08-05.

   `inherit` reads the PARENT's resolved value straight off its
   `:style/*` attrs (`parent-computed-value`), which works for a
   non-inherited property (`padding-left: inherit` under a
   `padding-left: 40px` parent now reports 40, where dropping it reported
   0 -- measured against Brave, `:cascade/inherit-on-a-non-inherited-
   property`) as well as for an inherited one. When the parent resolved
   nothing, the property is dropped instead, which lets the SAME
   already-existing `(or (:prop st) (:prop inherited))` fallback
   `cssom.layout` applies for genuinely-inherited properties do the real
   inheriting at layout time -- and is also, for a non-inherited property,
   exactly the initial value the parent itself computed.

   `initial` WRITES the property's initial value (`initial-values`) rather
   than dropping it, because dropping would leave the user-agent
   stylesheet's value standing: a `<p style=\"display: initial\">` reports
   `inline` in a browser, not the UA's `block`. `unset` is `inherit` on an
   inherited property (`inherited-properties`) and `initial` on every
   other. `revert` rolls the cascade back to the previous ORIGIN, which is
   why the entries below the winner are kept rather than discarded.

   `inherited-flow` -- the 7-arity form's last argument, and the reason the
   logical-to-physical rename can happen here at all: `{:writing-mode ...
   :direction ...}` as the PARENT resolved them, threaded down
   `run-cascade-walk` exactly like `parent-font-size` and `parent-display`
   already are, because both properties inherit and this element may not
   declare either. nil means \"no tree walk behind this call\" (every
   standalone `computed-style`/`pseudo-element-style-for` caller), which
   resolves to `initial-flow` -- the same honest simplification the
   `parent-display` argument already makes for blockification, and with the
   same consequence: a standalone `computed-style` on an element inside a
   `direction: rtl` ancestor maps its logical properties as if it were ltr.

   The rename itself is one `map` over `sorted`, BELOW the sort and ABOVE
   the group-by, and that position is the whole design -- see the
   `logical -> physical, at computed-value time` block above for the four
   declaration-order measurements it reproduces without any code of its
   own.

   Returns `[style flow]` -- the resolved map, and the element's own
   resolved `{:writing-mode :direction}`, which its children inherit.
   `resolve-style-for` is the same function without the second value, and
   is what every caller that does not walk a tree uses."

   non-pseudo simple-selector part matches `node`. Same specificity/layer/
   cascade resolution as any other declaration; declarations that don't
   target `pseudo-element` never contribute. Returns {} when no rule
   targets this pseudo-element on this node -- callers (e.g. cssom.layout)
   treat that the same as the pseudo-element not existing at all.

   This is the same resolution `computed-style`/`apply-cascade` already
   perform internally (attaching the result to the real element's own
   computed style under :pseudo/before / :pseudo/after) -- exposed directly
   here so callers can resolve a node's pseudo-element style without a full
   apply-cascade + DOM-attrs round trip. `content` values are already plain
   strings by the time they land in the returned map -- a quoted literal
   (see `parse-content-literal`) already was one, and a `content: attr(name)`
   reference (see `parse-content-attr-ref`/`resolve-content-value`) has
   already been resolved against `node`'s own real HTML attribute (`\"\"` if
   absent) by `resolve-style-for` above; `url()`/other unsupported `content`
   forms simply have no :content key in the returned map, same as `content`
   being absent.

   `content: counter(name)` is a REAL, DOCUMENTED LIMITATION of this
   standalone entry point specifically: unlike attr(), a counter's value is
   the cumulative effect of every counter-reset/counter-increment
   declaration on every element preceding this point in document tree order
   (see the namespace docstring) -- genuinely not derivable from `node` in
   isolation, with no document tree walk backing this call. So a
   `counter()` reference here is honestly left unresolved (no :content key,
   same as `content` being absent) rather than guessing a number. Only
   `apply-cascade`'s own top-down tree walk (see its docstring) can resolve
   `counter()` correctly, node by node, in document order.

   Mirrors `computed-style`'s own two arities -- the document-less 3-arity
   form has the same pseudo-class-matching restriction `matches?`'s
   document-less arity does (document-dependent pseudo-classes like
   :focus/:disabled won't match)."

  "Like `computed-style`, but for `apply-cascade`'s own top-down tree walk:
   resolves `node`'s base/::before/::after style given `inherited-counters`
   (the running named-counter map accumulated from every node that precedes
   `node` in document order -- see `apply-cascade`'s docstring), and returns
   `[style node-counters]`.

   `node-counters` is `inherited-counters` updated by `node`'s OWN
   `counter-reset` declaration (applied first) then its OWN
   `counter-increment` declaration (applied second) -- exactly real CSS's
   order (`apply-counter-pairs`) -- and is what descendants AND subsequent
   siblings should keep accumulating from.

   `node`'s ::before/::after `content: counter(name)` reference(s) resolve
   against `node-counters`, i.e. AFTER `node`'s own reset/increment already
   applied: matching real CSS, a `<li>` with both `counter-increment: item`
   and a `::before { content: counter(item); }` sees the INCREMENTED value,
   never the pre-increment one. This is only possible because
   counter-reset/counter-increment are read off `node`'s own BASE style
   first (`resolve-style-for ... nil inherited-counters` below), before
   ::before/::after are resolved at all.

   Known, honest simplification: `node`'s own (non-pseudo-element) `content`
   declaration, if it has one (unusual and not meaningfully rendered by real
   CSS on a regular element in the first place -- content only applies to
   generated ::before/::after boxes), is resolved against
   `inherited-counters` (pre-this-node), not `node-counters` -- it has to
   be, structurally: `node`'s own counter-reset/counter-increment
   declarations are read FROM that very same base-style resolution call, so
   `node-counters` isn't known yet at the point the base style resolves.
   Since real CSS doesn't render a plain element's own `content` anyway,
   this ordering choice has no real-world-visible consequence.

   `container-ctx` (see `resolve-style-for`'s own docstring) is threaded
   through unchanged to all three `resolve-style-for` calls below -- nil
   during apply-cascade's first pass (and from any standalone caller), the
   real containers/parent-index map during its second pass.

   `inherited-flow` is threaded the same way, and reaches the ::before/
   ::after resolutions too: a generated box sits in its originating
   element's flow, so `content` beside a `margin-inline-start` on the same
   ::before maps against the same direction the element itself resolved."

   the counters map children AND subsequent siblings should continue
   accumulating from (`inherited-counters` updated by this element's own

   chain has to come down the tree the same way (see
   `resolve-relative-lengths`). The extra return value is this element's
   own computed size, which its children inherit. Resolution runs AFTER
   `resolve-style-map` because a `font-size: var(--x)` is not a length
   until the substitution has happened, and it covers the pseudo-element
   maps too, against this element's size -- a `::before`'s `em` is its
   own font size, which it inherits from the element it hangs off.

   `parent-display` is the fourth thing this walk inherits, and it is
   inherited for exactly one reason: blockification (CSS Display 3 SS2.7,
   see `blockify-display`) rewrites a box's own `display` when its PARENT
   establishes a flex or grid formatting context, so the answer for this
   element is not derivable from this element. The extra return value is
   what this element's own children should be blockified against, which is
   its own computed display except for `display: contents` -- see
   `children-container-display`.

   `parent-flow` is the fifth, and it is inherited because BOTH of its
   halves are inherited CSS properties: an element with no `direction` of
   its own is in its parent's, and that is what decides which physical side
   its `margin-inline-start` lands on (see `logical->physical-by-flow`).
   The extra return value is this element's own resolved flow, which its
   children inherit -- computed in `resolve-style-for`, where the cascade
   that decides it already ran, rather than re-derived here from the
   written-back `:style/direction` (which would be wrong for an element
   that declares none, since this map holds no inherited values)."

   threading this does) -- factored out so apply-cascade can run it TWICE
   when `rules` contains any `@container` rule (see apply-cascade's
   docstring for why two passes, never more, are enough): once with
   `container-ctx` nil (no @container rule ever contributes -- see
   `container-rule-matches?`) purely to discover every container-marked
   element's own width from its non-@container declarations, and once more
   with the real `container-ctx` built from that first pass's result, this
   time letting @container rules compete on equal footing with every other
   declaration. When `rules` has no @container rule at all, apply-cascade
   calls this exactly once with container-ctx nil -- byte-for-byte the same
   single walk this namespace always performed, so stylesheets that never
   use `@container` see no behavior or performance change.

   `base-font-size` is what the ROOT element's own relative units resolve
   against (see `apply-cascade`'s `:base-font-size`). `root-font-size`
   starts nil and is fixed by the FIRST element styled -- the root element,
   in document order -- to that element's own computed size, which is
   exactly what `rem` means for everything below it.

   A subtree unreachable from `:root` is styled with `base-font-size` as
   both its parent's and the root's size, the same honest simplification
   the empty inherited environment above it already makes: a detached node
   has no ancestor chain to read either number off."

(defn apply-cascade
  "Applies the cascade over `document`, writing each element's resolved
   style onto its :style/* attrs (and :pseudo/before / :pseudo/after where
   applicable -- see `computed-style`).

   Walks top-down from the document root so CSS custom properties inherit
   from ancestor to descendant. Any element unreachable from :root (e.g. a
   detached subtree) still gets styled, using an empty inherited environment,
   to preserve the previous flat-walk behavior for those nodes.

   This same top-down walk also threads a running named-counter map (see
   `style-with-counters`/`style-element`), alongside (but NOT the same as)
   the custom-property environment: `counter-reset`/`counter-increment`
   are NOT inherited properties (each element's own declaration affects only
   itself, exactly like every other non-inherited CSS property, and exactly
   like the custom-property environment already does NOT get threaded
   sideways between siblings) -- but a counter's VALUE is nonetheless a
   running total across the WHOLE preceding document (ancestors, preceding
   siblings, and everything nested inside them), because that's what
   `content: counter(name)` actually reads. So unlike the custom-property
   environment (recomputed fresh, unaffected by siblings, for every child
   from its parent's fixed `node-env`), the counters map threaded into the
   next sibling is the one that comes OUT of the previous sibling's ENTIRE
   subtree, not the one going INTO it -- i.e. it is threaded through the
   `reduce` over children the same way `document`/`visited` already are,
   not passed down as a fixed value the way `node-env` is. This is a real,
   deliberate, honest simplification of real CSS's actual (element-nesting
   scoped) counter scoping rules: this engine keeps counters in one flat,
   per-document namespace instead (see the namespace docstring).

   `opts` (optional, 3-arity) may include :viewport-width (default
   `default-viewport-width`) used to decide whether `@media (min-width:...)`
   / `(max-width:...)` rule blocks apply, :color-scheme (default
   `default-color-scheme`, \"light\"/\"dark\") used to decide whether
   `@media (prefers-color-scheme: ...)` rule blocks apply, and
   :base-font-size (default `default-base-font-size`, 16).

   :base-font-size is what the ROOT element's own `em`/`%`/`smaller` resolve
   against, and what `rem` means in a document whose root declares no
   font-size. It is one number and it is only ever the START of the chain:
   the moment any element declares a font-size, its own subtree resolves
   against THAT (see `resolve-relative-lengths`), which is why this is an
   opt rather than the design -- a single base size cannot express `em`
   compounding, and compounding is what a browser does. A caller that
   supplies nothing gets `default-base-font-size`, the size this engine's
   own theme draws at; see that def for what it costs and why it is not
   CSS's 16.

   `@container` support (see the namespace docstring's own `@container`
   paragraph for the feature's scope) is why this function may run
   `run-cascade-walk` TWICE rather than once -- and why it never needs a
   third time, or a loop, to do it:

   1. If `rules` contains no `@container` rule at all (`(some :rule/container
      rules)` is nil), this is exactly the single walk this function always
      performed -- no new code path, no behavior change, no extra cost.

   2. Otherwise, PASS 1 runs `run-cascade-walk` over only the non-@container
      rules (`container-ctx` nil, so even if it were somehow passed an
      @container rule, `container-rule-matches?` would drop it) -- this
      resolves every element's OWN `width`/`min-width`/`max-width` (among
      everything else) exactly as real, unconditional, non-@container CSS
      would set them. `build-containers` then scans that pass's resulting
      document for every `container-type: inline-size`/`size` element and
      records its resolved width (`resolvable-container-width`) -- a NUMBER
      only when the author wrote a literal `<n>`/`<n>px` value, honestly
      nil otherwise (see that function's docstring): this engine does not
      run real layout, so any width that depends on layout (auto/
      percentage/flex/grid-driven sizing) is, and stays, unknown here,
      never guessed at.

   3. PASS 2 runs `run-cascade-walk` again, this time over the FULL `rules`
      (including @container ones) and a real `container-ctx` (the
      containers map from step 2, plus `parent-index` so
      `container-rule-matches?` can walk from any node up to its nearest
      matching container) -- letting @container-conditioned declarations
      compete on specificity/layer/order exactly like any other declaration
      for every node, now that container widths are known. This pass's
      result is what `apply-cascade` returns.

   This is deliberately bounded -- one extra full pass, never an iterated
   fixpoint/relayout loop -- which is exactly why it is scoped the way it
   is: a container whose own width isn't resolvable from pass 1 (because it
   depends on layout, or on ANOTHER, ancestor container's own @container
   rule -- nested/chained container queries are explicitly unsupported, see
   the namespace docstring) simply makes @container rules inside it not
   apply, rather than this function looping passes until things stabilize."
